# Ford Motor Company – Ready Set Ford Marketing Intelligence Memo (Draft)

## 1. Executive Summary
Ready Set Ford should be positioned as a marketing intelligence flywheel that protects Ford’s loyalty core while unlocking premium growth. Secondary data indicate Ford’s truck loyalty sits at **65.1%**, the highest in the industry, creating a defensible base that must be maintained through Capability and Trust messaging.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] At the same time, emerging lifestyle signals—Google search interest, social chatter, and a vibrant collectible-car economy—show headroom to monetize passion-led segments. We recommend a three-phase roadmap: (1) immediate instrumentation of campaign metrics and dealer storytelling, (2) a 90–180 day research sprint to validate lifestyle promises and EV value propositions, and (3) a 12-month BI build that fuses syndicated loyalty data, telematics, and content engagement into a single dashboard for Ford Blue, Model e, and Ford Pro leaders.

## 2. Strategic Context – Loyalty Baselines
Ford enters FY2025 needing to stoke demand amid EV headwinds, price pressure, and a skills gap in marketing analytics documented in class notes. The J.D. Power 2024 loyalty study reports Toyota (62.5%) and Honda (58.8%) maintaining mass-market car loyalty leadership, Lexus leading premium SUVs at 60.2%, and Ford topping the truck segment at 65.1%.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] These figures set quantitative guardrails around Ready Set Ford’s promises: any erosion in truck loyalty risks delivering the segment to Toyota (60.8%), while to gain SUV share Ford must displace Honda (64.2%) with differentiated Brand + Adventure stories. Incorporating these benchmarks into our dashboards ensures leadership can track lifestyle claims against real customer retention.

## 3. Marketing Intelligence Assessment
Class frameworks emphasize a loop of problem definition → research design → data synthesis. Secondary assets already collected—SEC filings, Ford Pro press releases (ServiceTitan integration, managed charging pilot), J.D. Power loyalty benchmarks, McKinsey insights on heritage value, Google Trends, and Twitter listening—answer “what is happening” today. Outstanding gaps require a structured primary program:
- **Qualitative sprint (Oct 6–24):** 12 dealer interviews and 18 lifestyle persona ethnographies (Build/Thrill/Adventure) to stress-test narrative fit, surface proof-point gaps, and capture verbatim stories for creative briefs.
- **Quantitative sprint (Nov 3–21):** Conjoint survey (n≈800) on EV price/value mixes plus a loyalty pulse (n≈1,200) mapping cross-shop risk vs. Toyota/Honda; results feed perceptual maps of Ready Set Ford promises against competitors.^[data/external/market_stats.csv]
- **Operational analytics integration:** Instrument dealer portal interaction metrics, ingest Ford Pro telematics adoption data, and fuse social sentiment into the BI backlog to close the loop on campaign performance.
The collectors’ economy (≈€800B stock value)^[data/external/market_stats.csv] remains a key hypothesis: research should quantify how heritage cues influence willingness to pay for limited editions or premium service bundles.

## 4. Segment Diagnostics – Leveraging Enthusiast Equity
Ford Blue can use Ready Set Ford storytelling to connect heritage pride with practical capability. McKinsey’s collectible-car study quantifies the cultural leverage: average auction prices (~€65k) and listings (~€56k) demonstrate that passion converts into spend, while the $143M sale of Mercedes’ 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé shows how legacy engineering fuels brand halo.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] For Model e, survey work should segment EV intenders by lifestyle pillar and test how heritage cues (Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning) influence conversion. Ford Pro should showcase telematics and charging ROI using the ServiceTitan and Southern Company pilots already parsed in `data/external/ford_press_metrics.csv`. Early digital pulse readings reinforce the segmentation logic: Google Trends now registers Ready Set Ford awareness (index = 1 in mid-September versus a long-run zero baseline) while Ford Pro searches remain steady around 29 (notes/research_notes.md:58), and social hashtags concentrate on #Ford, #ReadySetFord, #Mustang, and dealer-run promotions (notes/research_notes.md:60). Together, these diagnostics justify a pipeline of hero content and customer research that extends Ready Set Ford beyond awareness.

- **Ford Blue:** Stabilize EBIT pressure ($5.3B in 2024, down year-on-year) by pairing launch storytelling with quality proof points gathered from dealer ethnography and loyalty benchmarks.^[(notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:2942)] Prioritize mixed-media content that celebrates Build personas (capability + community) while feeding dealer portals with data-backed talking points.
- **Model e:** Address price compression and 35% revenue decline through conjoint testing on total cost of ownership offers, followed by rapid experimentation on EV education content.^[(notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:3008)] Monitor digital engagement leading indicators (Ready Set Ford search index, EV video completion) to anticipate funnel softness.
- **Ford Pro:** Leverage the 15% revenue growth and 13.5% EBIT margin expansion to provide tangible ROI stories tied to ServiceTitan workflows and managed charging savings for fleets.^[(notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:3071)] Use Ready Set Ford to humanize Pro’s data services by spotlighting contractor wins surfaced in qualitative interviews.

## 5. Business Intelligence Roadmap – Integrating Lifestyle Signals
We recommend standing up a Ready Set Ford dashboard with three tiers:
- **Loyalty & Retention** – Monthly ingest of J.D. Power loyalty rates and Ford internal retention to flag gaps vs. Toyota/Honda/Lexus targets.^[data/external/market_stats.csv]
- **Lifestyle & Engagement** – Google Trends indices for “Ready Set Ford” vs “Ford Pro,” Twitter volume/hashtag mix, and YouTube view + like rates (see `data/external/youtube_metrics.csv` and `notes/youtube_snapshot.md`). The accompanying visuals (`deck/visuals/google_trends_readysetford_us.png`, `deck/visuals/twitter_readysetford_top_hashtags.png`) should update alongside each data refresh to keep the deck decision-ready.
- **Product & Proof Points** – Ford Pro telematics wins, charging savings, and limited-edition run rates referencing press-release metrics. A “Heritage Equity Index” would track collectible-inspired launches and waitlist velocity, aligned with the €800B collectible market opportunity.
Governance should include a cross-functional intelligence council, a data glossary, and training derived from class Industry 4.0 notes to close the analytics skill gap. Add a quarterly “insight review” cadence that pairs marketing, dealer enablement, and Ford Pro analytics leaders to retire stale dashboards, greenlight new data experiments, and document decision triggers. To avoid the “insights without action” pitfall highlighted in the Marketing Intelligence reading, every KPI should have an accountable owner, hypothesis, and response playbook before it goes live (notes/research_notes.md:46).

## 6. Recommendations & Next Steps
**0–90 days:** Instrument campaign analytics (YouTube + social dashboards), publish the Ready Set Ford video slide as a living asset, refresh the digital-pulse visuals after each data pull, and run qualitative interviews with dealers and target personas to test lifestyle promises. Capture verbatims in `notes/research_notes.md` to accelerate creative iterations and keep the problem-definition → research-design → synthesis loop active (notes/research_notes.md:46). Deliverables: qualitative learning brief, KPI stub dashboard, refreshed video performance slide.
**90–180 days:** Launch conjoint/quant surveys on EV value and capability perceptions, codify telematics case studies, and roll out dealer enablement kits with loyalty benchmarks. Stand up a working dashboard prototype using refreshed scripts as recurring data sources and the new visuals as baseline widgets. Pair the prototype rollout with training modules for marketing, analytics, and dealer teams to mitigate the Industry 4.0 skills gap (notes/research_notes.md:46). Deliverables: conjoint insights deck, dealer enablement toolkit, dashboard alpha with KPI owners assigned.
**180+ days:** Operationalize the BI dashboard, integrate telematics + CRM feeds, and formalize an annual marketing intelligence plan that cycles datasets from `scripts/collect_additional_data.py` and `scripts/extract_market_stats.py`. Layer in governance milestones (analytics training, data glossary reviews, insight review forums) so the intelligence flywheel remains sustainable and auditable. Deliverables: production dashboard with SLA, governance operating manual, FY26 marketing intelligence roadmap.
