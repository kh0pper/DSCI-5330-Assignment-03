ercedes-Benz made only two 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupés. The two-seat cars, which were manufactured in 1955, are nicknamed “The
Red” and “The Blue” based on their interior colors. With long, sleek hoods and passenger doors that open from the top, the cars were

designed for the racetrack and had a maximum speed of 300 kilometers per hour, making them far faster than their contemporaries. Ironically, the
Uhlenhaut Coupés never entered a race because Mercedes-Benz decided to exit the motorsport business shortly after creating the two
prototypes. The cars’ rarity may explain why The Red set a new record for automobiles when it sold for $143 million (about €137 million) at auction
in 2022. Its partner, The Blue, remains at the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart.
The Uhlenhaut Coupé sale shows the enduring appeal of legendary cars. Other collectibles are equally in high demand, including models from
luxury brands such as Ferrari, Aston Martin, Bugatti, Lamborghini, and Porsche, as well as those from mainstream brands such as Chevrolet,
Nissan and Ford. Like the Uhlenhaut Coupé, some models have sold for astronomical prices—a 1962 Ferrari GTO went for about $51.7 million at
auction (about €50 million) in 2023—but the average transaction price is about €65,000 for auctions and €56,000 for public listings, given that a
large portion of the market consists of more accessible vehicles.
Today’s most popular collectibles span a number of decades, with models from the 1980s through the 2000s recently demonstrating a significant
increase in both public appreciation and valuations. The growing interest in these vehicles pushed the global value of the existing stock of
collectible cars to around €800 billion in 2024.
While collectible cars represent only a small number of total automotive sales, their influence extends far beyond an exclusive group of wealthy
buyers. Interest is so great that it can shape both public opinion and cultural trends, meaning that OEMs can leverage collectible cars to
strengthen customer relations, connect with high-net worth individuals, improve brand perception, and capture new opportunities. Other
automotive stakeholders, including insurers and repair shops, may also find new revenue streams and profits from collectibles.
We conducted extensive research about the size, value, and characteristics of today’s collectible car market to help guide OEMs and others who
want to benefit from this growing segment. Given that consumer demand is the biggest factor affecting the growth of the collectibles market, we
also surveyed more than 250 collectible-car enthusiasts and professionals worldwide about their vehicle preferences, driving habits, and
purchase plans. In combination, these insights reveal emerging opportunities and critical next steps for all automotive stakeholders that want to
benefit from the surging interest in collectible cars. (For more information on the methodology, see sidebar “Our survey methodology.”)

A thriving and evolving market for collectible cars
Collectibles are sometimes referred to as “classic” cars. On the highest level, they are cars that inspire people to dream of ownership, even if it
may take years to achieve that goal. When behind the wheel, drivers typically feel a rush of emotions inspired by a more analog and unfiltered
driving experience. Collectible cars also allow their owners to enjoy creative, cutting-edge designs no longer possible on modern cars because of
current safety regulations.
For our research, we defined “collectible vehicles” as those that have been out of production for at least five years and valued at €20,000 or
more. They also have some intangible characteristics that are less easy to quantify—for instance, how iconic, important, sporty, or advanced the
car was considered during its early days, as well as its current reputation. In other words, a collectible car must be more than just a mobility
solution. Our definition encompasses roughly 3,660 models globally, from more than 260 manufacturers, some of which are no longer active.
Iconic cars such as the Ford Model T and the Lamborghini Miura have been trading hands for years, but the steepest increases in car values
began in the 2000s, coinciding with the period in which leading automotive brands began drawing inspiration from their heritage and launching
retro-inspired models. Community activities for auto enthusiasts, including rallies with vintage cars and concours d’elegance, contributed to the
uptick in interest and increased the perception that older model cars could be prestigious collectibles.

Collectible cars: From niche market to growth and innovation engine | McKinsey
The 2020s showed sustained value increases and consumer interest, partly because both traditional and digital media sources presented
collectible cars favorably. The upswing in consumer demand is part of a greater trend that sees vintage products such as spirits, watches, jewelry,
and handbags, surging in value across sectors. The rise of digital marketplaces and online auction sites also contributes to the growth of
collectible sales by broadening access to products.
The customer base for collectibles has evolved along with the market. Before the 2000s, global luxury buyers primarily viewed vintage goods as
status symbols; today, younger luxury buyers tend to be less focused on conspicuous consumption, and instead value collectibles because of
their uniqueness and brand authenticity. A brand’s backstory also carries more weight with collectors, and selected manufacturers have opted to
build on their heritage to lay the foundations for their future, as French car manufacturer Alpine did by using the original A110 from the 1960s to
relaunch its brand in 2017.

Today’s collectors are highly active, with about 5 percent of cars changing hands annually for a trade volume of €45 billion. About 5,000 trades
involve vehicles valued at above €500,000. Collectible cars from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s have been the major value and liquidity growth
driver for the past ten years, perhaps because many millennials first encountered these models as children and aspired to own them as adults. In
a related trend, the share of cars from the 1980s through 2000s at public auctions has sharply increased over the past five years to reach an
average of 29 percent, compared to 13 percent for cars from the 1970s; meanwhile, the average age of cars being auctioned off has dropped from
a peak of 54 years in 2012 to only 38 years in the first half of 2024.

Opportunities along the collectibles value chain
For automotive industry stakeholders along the value chain, the collectibles market represents an opportunity worth €76 billion to €90 billion in
annual revenue. Given the growing interest in collectibles, the potential for profit could rise, especially if OEMs and ecosystem players can learn
from other segments that offer vintage goods and develop new products and services for this market.
The collectibles value chain is complex, with multiple segments containing many small, independent players. As the industry grows, some
businesses may attempt to consolidate or adopt universal standards, which would make the market easier to navigate. To get a clear idea of the
opportunities ahead and value at stake, we identified six key industry segments (Exhibit 1).

Trading and brokerage of collectible cars
Numerous dealers, brokers, auction houses, platforms, and individuals trade collectible cars. Their activities represent the largest part of the value
chain, generating about€40 billion to€45 billion in annual revenues.
Approximately 30 to 40 percent of cars are sold through public listings, including dealer offerings and classified ads. For unlisted sales, about half
of trades involve individual collectors. While third parties or agents often facilitate these transactions, innovators have recently launched several
new platforms to connect buyers and sellers directly for a fraction of the typical cost.
Auctions account for only 15 to 30 percent of unlisted sales. Those numbers are rising, however, because many buyers appreciate the ability to
see feedback on sellers and participate in a community experience. In addition, many online-auction buyers say that they now feel more confident
when making bids because of the increased availability of public data, including information on previous transactions, car value, and past auction
results.

Vehicle manufacturing
This segment involves the production of “extended/continuation series” of historic vehicles, the reproduction/replication of vintage cars, and the
creation of “restomods”—short for restoration modifications—which are classic cars modified and updated to modern technical standards.
Revenue from vehicle manufacturing is about €0.2 billion to €0.3 billion annually.
While customer demand for restomods or replicas is high, some OEM leaders are concerned that these vehicles are not identical to the originals.
Nevertheless, a number of OEMs sanction some efforts and support some continuation series. Consider Aston Martin, which recently offered
remanufactured versions of two of its rarest sports cars, the DB4GT and DB4GT Zagato, as well as a faithful reproduction of the DB5 driven by
Sean Connery as 007 in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger—functioning gadgets included. Recent engineering advances have made it easier
for companies to produce quality restomods and replicas, even during small-scale production, which is opening the door for more businesses.

Logistics and storage
Cars increasingly require international transport as more buyers engage in cross-border historic racing, attend collectible car events, or simply
engage in overseas transactions. Customers thus need dedicated logistics companies that can facilitate a smooth trip. Many collectible cars also
have special storage requirements, including those related to climate control, fire prevention, and heightened security standards that necessitate
customized garages. Some organizations that rent garage space also host special events or meetings of private clubs; others offer on-site
automotive services for greater convenience.

Collectible cars: From niche market to growth and innovation engine | McKinsey
Overall, the logistics and storage segment generates about €1 billion to €2 billion in annual revenue. It is expected to grow because storage is
among the greatest pain points for collectible car owners, and a significant number of players are building dedicated, experiential facilities to
meet those needs.
See sidebar “Motorworld: Creating a community for collectible car enthusiasts,” for more information on available services.

Administration, financing, insurance, and regulation
An often underappreciated side of the collectibles market involves financing and insuring these vehicles—activities that now generate about €8
billion to €10 billion in revenue annually. Some large traditional companies offer policies specifically designed for collectibles, and a few smaller
businesses also focus on this area. Specialty insurers tend to extract more value from their clients and maintain the relationships for extended
periods by offering community events, special insights, and partnerships.
Although many high-net-worth individuals purchase collectibles, traditional banks and leasing companies tend to underserve the market. Few of
them currently offer dedicated financial products or collectible-car specialists to support their clients.
In our survey, a significant number of customers financed their collectible-car purchase (Exhibit 2). Interestingly, for vehicles priced under
€100,000, only 15 percent of sales involve financing; this figure rises to 55 percent for vehicles in the €100,000 to €500,000 range, and to over
80 percent for those priced over €500,000. Some buyers also opted for co-investments with family, friends, or partners to avoid financing, and a
few relied on new crowdfunding solutions.
Exhibit 2

Bank loans currently represent a relatively small portion of financing deals. Some private banks are becoming more interested in financing
collectible cars, however, and are sponsoring events that might interest collectors. Other sources of funding include niche players outside the
banking sector, which tend to offer shorter-term loans and higher rates for collectibles compared to those for new cars. As the collectibles market
grows, financing could potentially increase to two- to three-fold over the near term, considering that the penetration of financing tends to
increase as car values increase.
The collectible car market is highly regulated. Some organizations, such as the Fedération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens and the Classic
Car Club of America, are increasingly attempting to set technical standards. Others, such as the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile, are
establishing sporting regulations.
In some cases, governments may decide to introduce legislation that helps the collectibles market through favorable legislation (for instance,
exempting such cars from congestion fees or decreasing the vehicle tax).

Maintenance, restoration, and spare parts

Collectible cars: From niche market to growth and innovation engine | McKinsey
Like all older cars, collectibles need routine maintenance to stay in top shape. This service, combined with restoration and the sourcing or
remanufacture of spare parts, generates about€25 billion to€30 billion in annual revenues. While this segment is the second largest value-chain
pool after trading and brokerage, it is also among the most fragmented. Many collectible-car mechanics work in small independent shops—about
75 percent have fewer than 8 employees—and specialize in different areas. With numerous shop owners planning to retire and a shortage of
skilled replacements, companies will likely consolidate, explore new business models, and increase prices.
In our survey, many respondents state that they are extremely selective when choosing a service provider. Among collectors with six or more cars,
54 percent indicate that they want to deal with the best specialty services center, no matter where in the world it is located, compared to only 35
percent of respondents with fewer cars (Exhibit 3). Respondents with many cars are also more likely to use the official restoration unit at their car
manufacturer, provided that the OEM offers that service. Some respondents also perform their own maintenance or deal with local garages,
highlighting the relevance of B2C channels for parts and the growing interest in technical education by collectors.
Exhibit 3

When asked about their goals for restorations, 35 percent of survey respondents say they want to keep their vehicles completely authentic.
Smaller percentages of respondents are open to upgrades that improve performance or reliability, even if those changes detract from
authenticity, and some respondents want to make custom upgrades, rather than adhering to the original specifications. These findings contradict
a common belief that customers want cars that are either identical to the last bolt to how they left the production line decades earlier, or extreme
reinterpretations. Instead, the survey results to indicate that some collectors want their cars to reflect the vehicles’ original spirit while becoming a
little more pleasant to use in today’s traffic. Respondents welcome safer brakes, “hidden” power steering, improved air conditioning, or the option
to charge a smartphone.
The spare-parts market could benefit from new fabrication techniques, such as 3D scanning and 3D printing of parts, which have the potential to
decrease costs and increase availability, particularly for collectible cars used for racing purposes.

Community and experience
Collectible vehicles inherently touch numerous emotional “strings” and thus appeal to a wide variety of people. Although some may value
collectibles for their driving characteristics, others might primarily view them as objects of art, a means for enjoying beautiful surroundings, or a
highly fascinating engineering marvel. Various groups have created experiences and events that cater to different interests, including races and
exhibitions, and these now generate between €2 billion to €4 billion annually from participants and spectators. Some of the most popular
collectible events, such as the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, the 1000 Miglia, and Goodwood Revival, are now oversubscribed. In

response, organizations have created more exclusive formats, such as members-only meetings at Goodwood or the “1000 Miglia experience
UAE.”

Two famous collectible events, the century-old Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este and the newer FuoriConcorso, extend the focus from cars to
lifestyle and art to attract more—and more diverse— attendees to to the shores of Lake Como. Since many consumers increasingly seek unique
products and experiences, these curated trips may boost interest in collectible cars and in the ecosystem of brands associated with them. They
also appeal to buyers who want direct experience with vehicles before making a purchase.
See sidebar “The Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance,” for information on one of the most famous events.
Private driving clubs are also enhancing the collectibles experience by organizing drives, events, and get-togethers to appeal to a growing
community of passionate collectors and investors. Some clubs offer dedicated sites, including private facilities and racetracks, that allow owners
to have a place of their own close to their passion—for instance, there might be a private garage or even a residence close to a racetrack. As of
2024, there are more than 20 private racetracks and clubs under construction worldwide, and demand is still growing for other locations where
people can enjoy their passion for motoring.

Gaining an edge by meeting customer needs
Every collectibles business must understand the customer base because consumer demand is the strongest growth driver for the segment. Our
survey data reveals several customer insights that could help companies chart a path forward.

For collectible car enthusiasts, it all starts with the driving experience
When asked why they purchased a collectible, the vast majority of survey respondents say that they are primarily motivated by a personal interest
in driving (Exhibit 4). Other aspects of the ownership experience, such as the ability to attend collectible car events or participate in races, also
appeal to many people. Those findings help explain why many leading brands are increasingly offering premium driving experiences and providing
owners with opportunities to maximize their enjoyable time behind the wheel of their collectibles. In many cases, the brands are emphasizing the
community aspect by combining driving experiences with opportunities for artistic and culinary enjoyment, visits to historic sites, and in-person
social networking.

In our survey, about 90 respondents say that they are mostly interested in collectibles because of their asset value. Until very recently, it would
have been difficult to quantify this value, as well as the appreciation potential, because information was not readily available. When making a
purchase, many collectors simply followed their instinct and did not always select the vehicle that would represent the best investment. Now,
however, professionally run investment platforms have emerged, increasing transparency about asset value and providing data-driven insights on
future expectations and market liquidity. That said, collectors should not assume that every purchase will lead to a profit; instead, they should view
collectible cars as a hobby that might offer a better long-run cash curve than most. See sidebar “AssetClassic: Taking an investor’s lens to
collectible cars,” for more information.
Only a minority of respondents say that their primary interest in collectibles results from the status associated with owning a unique or expensive
car.
While survey respondents highly value the driving experience, many of them manage to spend only a few hours behind the wheel each month.
Some are busy and others lack a place where they can enjoy driving. Relatively few state that they regularly take short trips in their collectible cars
and even fewer routinely take long trips (Exhibit 5). Our survey also shows that collectors enjoy their vehicles even when they are not on the road.
For instance, many respondents say that they enjoy tinkering with their vehicles and visiting shows on collectible cars at museums and
exhibitions. Reflecting a growing trend, some respondents say that they create video blogs, photographic tours, or other video/digital content
about their passion for collectible cars, which could create a unique opportunity for brands to engage in co-creation with their customers while
simultaneously fostering appreciation and community building.

For most collectors, the greatest joy comes from sharing their interest with
others
Our survey respondents enjoy sharing their passion for collectible cars with others—most often their partners but also their friends and children.
Sharing their interest allows drivers to enjoy their passion for motoring in new ways—for instance, by transforming it into a weekend activity for a
couple. Most commonly, respondents give rides or let other collectors drive their cars, but they also engage in other shared experiences, such as
working on cars together or attending car shows with friends. When seeking fellow car enthusiasts outside of their immediate circle, respondents
under age 40 were most likely to use social media platforms, while older respondents preferred in-person gatherings or events (Exhibit 6). Other
popular resources included classic car clubs, online forums, and digital platforms, or events sponsored by car manufacturers. By hosting
community events for collectibles, OEMs and other businesses could get an opportunity to connect with customers who might also become
interested in their new offerings—and the perception of high value that surrounds collectibles could extend to more recent models.

See sidebar “The Goodwood Revival” for more information on community events.

A greater focus on quality, authenticity, and trust could improve
relationships with collectors
In our survey, many respondents focus on a car model’s brand and heritage when selecting a collectible. They are also concerned about
practicalities, however, including the availability of authentic spare parts. Of course, the relative weight of these elements varies depending upon
a vehicle’s value: while availability of spares might be a significant influencer in the decision to buy a 1990s mass production sportscar, it may be
less relevant in the purchase of a highly valuable 1950s racing vehicle with a documented history.
When asked about the greatest challenges related to acquiring, restoring, and reselling collectible vehicles, most respondents focus on trust
issues (Exhibit 7). They worry that sellers are not being fully transparent about the condition of their cars and that prices and commercial terms
may not be fair. Related to this, many respondents feel that deeper vehicle knowledge, including information on specific models, is hard to come
by. Traders that strive to provide complete information about collectible cars, including any repairs or flaws, could gain a long-term edge by
attracting a loyal following, even if the disclosures may cost a short-term sale. Likewise, sellers might win more repeat business by ensuring that
prices reflect a vehicle’s condition and providing warranties or restoration support.

Some respondents also have concerns about delivery logistics, storage, serviceability (for instance, availability of authentic spare parts), physical
protection of vehicles from damage or theft, and the bureaucracy involved with importing, registration, and emissions testing. Businesses that can
mitigate problems in these areas are poised to capture opportunities. Some “car concierge” offerings are already growing rapidly in large urban
areas or at track-clubs around the globe and are playing an increasingly strategic role in making collectible car ownership an enjoyable
experience.

Innovation as a driver of growth and preservation
It may seem counterintuitive to believe that collectible cars can be a catalyst for innovation, but the numerous technologies used to support the
preservation, usage, and enjoyment of collectibles can indeed open new business opportunities. Already, companies are deploying innovative
services and new operating models to address some of the challenges that collectors face and developing new products that could trickle up to
mass market adoption. Relevant fields of innovation include:
Digital and AI. Thanks to AI, it is now possible to attribute a value to a car by aggregating millions of data points across multiple sources,
enabling more accurate and informed decisions. Buyers are already benefitting from the increased transparency, and this, in turn, might
increase trading frequency and support long-term growth in asset pricing. Similarly, the development of a “digital passport” for collectible cars,
which would involve identifying a vehicle through image-recognition of individual parts associated to a vehicle identification number and then
leveraging blockchain technology to secure its authenticity, could simplify vehicle authentication. In another development, the industry could
leverage a combination of AI and augmented reality to improve driver training for collectible cars. This technology, which is already being tested,
could help younger generations develop a passion for collectible cars.
Sustainable materials and fuels. As the world contends with the growing impact of climate change, the collectible car sector is under
increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices. With evolving regulations and shifting consumer expectations, the industry must innovate to
remain both relevant and environmentally responsible. Fossil-free and carbon-neutral fuels can offer a critical solution for significantly reducing
the environmental impact of collectible cars, and their broader availability and adoption might allow enthusiasts to enjoy their passion even more
responsibly, while possibly meeting future regulatory requirements. Increasing the availability of sustainable fuel at collectible car events and
racetracks will be critical to accelerating this transition. Fueled by carbon-neutral fuels and with their vehicle-manufacturing carbon impact
already behind us, collectible cars can be a sustainable answer to the desire for a recreational vehicle.
Modern craftsmanship. Companies that maintain collectible cars or manufacture continuation-series vehicles or restomods require highly
skilled workers with knowledge of bygone manufacturing techniques and the ability to use new technologies for parts fabrication and assembly.
For example, workers must know how to apply innovative “additive manufacturing” techniques to produce otherwise unavailable parts and
improve frequent-failure parts, thereby extending the lifespan of vintage vehicles. Many of our interview subjects highlighted talent availability

10/11

9/19/25, 7:46 PM

Collectible cars: From niche market to growth and innovation engine | McKinsey
as a future challenge for the collectible-cars sector, and companies must become more aggressive in recruiting and training skilled
preservationists. Select industrial districts are increasingly promoting education of technical and engineering personnel to ensure the
serviceability and preservation of collectible vehicles. The required knowledge—for instance, on restoring aluminum bodywork, carburetors, or
wooden interiors—often resides exclusively in an aging generation of mechanics and specialists. Codifying and retaining this expertise and
craftsmanship will be an enabler for the future of collectible cars.
Better experiential offerings. To help customers appreciate and enjoy collectible cars, companies are increasingly designing ad-hoc
hospitality offerings and creating dedicated infrastructures for storage and maintenance. From custom-made tours in iconic locations to historic
car racing events to next-generation interactive museums, experiential automotive offerings are becoming more sophisticated and blending the
boundaries between high-level hotels, travel management, and traditional automotive experiences. Innovative technologies such as digital
interfaces for booking, can facilitate a smooth customer journey for these experiences. Similarly, innovative event formats may attract more
customers and help them share their enjoyment with friends and followers.

Collectible cars have an appeal that extends beyond the design, heritage, and driving experience they offer. For many buyers, they represent the
fulfillment of a dream, inspire strong emotions, constitute a path of personal growth, and serve as a legacy for future generations. Car
manufacturers and ecosystem players have the opportunity to build upon the growing enthusiasm for collectibles to improve brand perception,
capture economic opportunities, and strengthen customer loyalty. They may find that these masterpieces from the past provide a solid path to
future growth and customer engagement.
