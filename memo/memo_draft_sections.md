# Ford Marketing Intelligence Memo – Draft Sections

## 2. Strategic Context – Loyalty Baselines
Ford enters FY2025 with a defensible loyalty core that the Ready Set Ford campaign must protect while expanding addressable segments. J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Automotive Brand Loyalty Study reports that Ford retains **65.1%** of truck buyers—the highest loyalty score across any segment—while Toyota and Honda dominate mass-market cars at **62.5%** and **58.8%** respectively, and Lexus leads premium SUVs at **60.2%**.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] These benchmarks establish the minimum performance thresholds for Ready Set Ford’s “Capability” and “Trust” promises: any decline in truck loyalty risks ceding the segment to Toyota (60.8%), while share gains in SUVs require messaging that differentiates Ford against Honda’s 64.2% repeat rate. The memo will frame these numbers as leading indicators in our executive summary dashboard and in segment-specific callouts for Ford Blue and Model e.

## 4. Segment Diagnostics – Leveraging Enthusiast Equity
Ford’s storytelling advantage extends beyond utility vehicle owners. McKinsey’s **Collectible cars** market study estimates the global stock of collectible vehicles at roughly **€800 billion (~$860B)**, with auction transactions averaging **€65,000** and public listings near **€56,000**.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] The report also highlights a record **$143M** sale for Mercedes-Benz’s 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé, underscoring the economic and cultural power of heritage nameplates. Ready Set Ford’s “Thrill” pillar can leverage this passion economy—Mustang special editions, Bronco heritage trims, and limited-run EV performance variants—to drive premium mix and experiential engagement. The diagnostic section will recommend primary research that tests how legacy cues influence purchase intent, and a BI workstream that surfaces collectible-style metrics (limited build counts, waitlist velocity) alongside core financial KPIs.

## 5. Business Intelligence Roadmap – Integrating Lifestyle Signals
To synthesize lifestyle demand with operational KPIs, the BI roadmap will integrate syndicated loyalty data (J.D. Power) and collector-market benchmarks (McKinsey) into Ford’s marketing data mart.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] Loyalty rates will anchor an early-warning scorecard for Ford Blue and Model e, while collectible valuations inform a “Heritage Equity Index” that tracks social listening, limited-edition conversion, and dealer waitlists. Coupled with the refreshed YouTube engagement dataset (`data/external/youtube_metrics.csv`), this approach ensures the dashboard ties quantitative benchmarks to Ready Set Ford’s lifestyle promises—Build, Thrill, and Adventure—rather than treating campaign metrics in isolation.
