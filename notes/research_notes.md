## Ford Marketing Approach (Primary Sources)
- Ford+ growth plan emphasizes “always-on” customer relationships, pairing vehicles with connected services across Ford Blue, Model e, and Ford Pro segments (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:281)
- Segment structure clarifies go-to-market focus: Ford Blue maintains ICE/hybrid portfolio, Model e incubates EV and software capabilities, and Ford Pro combines vehicles with digital fleet services such as telematics and charging (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:312)
- Dealer-led distribution remains core while Ford manages pricing, mix, and marketing incentives to defend share in a highly competitive environment (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:344)
- Proxy statement reinforces that effective marketing and communications are critical for loyalty and market share expansion—board governance treats marketing capability as a strategic skill (notes/Ford_2025_Proxy.txt:16736)

## Evidence on Marketing Outcomes
- **Ford Blue:** 2024 EBIT dropped to $5.3B as mix shifted away from high-margin trucks/SUVs and currency headwinds offset pricing, signalling need to fine-tune product marketing and launch execution (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:2942)
- **Ford Model e:** Revenue declined 35% and losses deepened due to lower net pricing amid EV competition, indicating current marketing offers and price positioning are struggling to convert demand (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:3008)
- **Ford Pro:** Revenue grew 15% with EBIT margin expanding to 13.5% on higher net pricing and fleet demand, showcasing effective commercial value proposition and bundled service marketing (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:3071)
- Marketing incentive programs (rebates, promotional financing, lease offers) are tracked as causal factors in segment profitability, underscoring need for data-driven spend allocation (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:3080)

## Business Intelligence Levers Already in Use
- Ford Pro’s telematics, software subscriptions, and charging services imply an integrated data platform that informs fleet optimization—key BI touchpoint for Assignment 3 deliverables (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:332)
- Digital services and connected vehicle technologies developed in Model e support enterprise-wide insights, providing customer usage data to refine marketing and CX strategies (notes/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.txt:325)

## External Media Insights (Sept 2025)
- USA Today frames “Ready, Set, Ford” as the company’s largest 2025 marketing push, positioned as an invitation to consumers and a signal of the pivot from product-first to human-first storytelling; rollout spans U.S. launch, targeted lifestyle messaging, and integration with Ford Philanthropy’s Building Together initiative (notes/USA_Today_Ready_Set_Ford.txt:40,46,70,84)
- Detroit News highlights the strategy’s resilience message amid economic headwinds, outlines the three lifestyle pillars (Build, Thrill, Adventure), and details how Ford plans to keep the campaign evergreen while balancing brand heritage, quality perceptions, and responsible AI use (notes/DetroitNews_Marketing_AI.txt:13,33,56,63,70,78)
- Ford’s own newsroom article emphasizes the internal commitments behind the campaign—four brand promises (Capability, Passion, Community, Trust), lifestyle-led planning, and showcasing hero products/services like Ford Pro to reignite aspiration (notes/FordNews_Introducing_Ready_Set_Ford.txt:19,51,74,85)

## Next Research Steps
1. Quantify marketing/advertising spend trends and promotional efficiency from Ford’s 10-K footnotes (and latest 10-Q once available).
2. Map “Ready, Set, Ford” lifestyle pillars to segment KPIs (Blue, Model e, Pro) to evaluate effectiveness and identify BI signals required to monitor each pillar.
3. Draft memo outline tying together internal performance data, campaign narrative, and BI opportunities; begin sourcing visuals for presentation deck.
