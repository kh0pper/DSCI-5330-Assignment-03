# Ford Motor Company – Marketing Strategy Assessment (Draft Outline)

## 1. Executive Summary
- Frame Ready Set Ford as a comprehensive marketing intelligence initiative aligned with Ford+ transformation.
- Summarize strongest opportunities: lifestyle-led campaigns informed by data, Model e pricing/experience corrections, Ford Pro intelligence scaling (ServiceTitan integration, managed charging pilot), and workforce/BI capability investments.

## 2. Strategic Context
- Market environment: EV adoption headwinds, tariff risks, consumer “polycrisis” sentiment, and industry digital transformation skill gaps (TechXplore, 2025).
- Ford+ architecture: roles of Ford Blue, Model e, Ford Pro; Ready Set Ford promises (Capability, Passion, Community, Trust) and lifestyle pillars (Build/Thrill/Adventure).

## 3. Marketing Intelligence Assessment
- Define intelligence objectives (problem framing, hypotheses) drawing on class frameworks (HBSP Marketing Intelligence reading).
- Secondary data landscape: SEC filings, syndicated data (Nielsen/J.D. Power), Ford Pro telematics, ServiceTitan dashboards.
- Primary research roadmap: qualitative empathy work (dealers, lifestyle customers), quantitative surveys/conjoint/perceptual mapping to validate promises and price/value perceptions; use pilot learnings (Southern Company managed charging) as hypothesis inputs.

## 4. Segment Diagnostics & Campaign Alignment
- Ford Blue: margin pressure, launch execution, loyalty risk; recommend research on emotional attachment/quality perceptions and targeted capability storytelling.
- Model e: price elasticity, infrastructure readiness, total cost of ownership; propose conjoint pricing tests, EV education content, and customer journey experiments.
- Ford Pro: document telematics partnerships (ServiceTitan) and charging pilot outcomes as proof points; expand case studies and quantify ROI for fleet operators (Build persona).
- Align Ready Set Ford creative with segment KPIs and lifestyle personas, ensuring metrics capture both rational and emotional outcomes.

## 5. Business Intelligence & Data Integration
- Current data assets: Ford Pro Intelligence, FordPass usage, connected vehicle data, CRM/dealer systems.
- BI enhancements: unified dashboards, lifestyle persona tracking, real-time campaign/charging analytics, customer sentiment loops; include human capital plan to upskill marketing and dealer teams (addressing Industry 4.0 skills gap).
- Governance: cross-functional intelligence council, data quality standards, ethical AI guardrails, training roadmap.
- Digital pulse: leverage Google Trends (Ready Set Ford searches spiking in mid-Sep 2025) and Twitter listening (25 recent posts, hashtags #Ford/#ReadySetFord/#Mustang) to monitor awareness and feedback in near real time.

## 6. Recommendations & Roadmap
- Short-term (0–90 days): refine campaign measurement, capture telematics/charging insights into marketing assets, launch qualitative pulse checks, build KPI starter dashboards.
- Mid-term (90–180 days): execute primary research (survey/conjoint), pilot BI-enabled personalization in key markets, integrate ServiceTitan/charging case studies into dealer playbooks.
- Long-term (180+ days): institutionalize marketing intelligence cycle (plan → collect → analyze → act), scale Ford Pro intelligence model enterprise-wide, align training programs with Human Capital 4.0 needs.
- Resource plan: talent requirements (research ops, data scientists, dealer enablement), budget direction, partnership opportunities (utilities, software platforms).

- Segment financial tables, lifestyle KPI baselines, and marketing intelligence maturity model.
