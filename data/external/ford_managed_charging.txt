late 1800s, with the establishment of Yellowstone as our first National Park in 1872, which was also the first year Arbor Day was celebrated.</p>","<p>The 1879 creation of the United States Geological Survey, and its ubiquitous topographic maps, allowed travelers to explore public lands with confidence. A desire to preserve and dedicate more land for the enjoyment of outdoor enthusiasts lead to the 1892 creation of the Sierra Club, followed in 1905 by the Audubon Society, whose primary focus on preserving bird habitats also benefitted campers.</p>","<p>During this era, expansion of railroads allowed adventurous folks to travel further afield along dedicated railways more easily, while the evolution of the automobile industry allowed more people than ever to chart their own path from increasingly cramped urban areas to unspoiled natural areas.</p>","<p>The Four Vagabonds — Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone, and John Burroughs — helped popularize car camping with their widely documented decade of outdoor trips beginning in 1915. One of the earliest camping organizations, the Tin Can Tourists, was founded in Florida in 1919, and many of its members traveled in customized Model T “Tin Lizzies” between Michigan and the Sunshine State.</p>","<p>Fast forward a few decades, to when Ford Motor Company used its long lineage of helping customers explore the great outdoors to offer its industry-first Camper Special package on 1965 F-100 and F-250 pickup trucks. With a Twin-I-Beam front suspension and a Flex-O-Matic rear suspension, these trucks could haul a heavy-duty camper and allow enthusiasts to explore the great outdoors while still enjoying modern comforts.</p>","<p>The Camper Special package also included a heavy-duty radiator, battery, and springs, with optional SelectAire conditioning and SelectShift Cruise-O-Matic transmission to ensure a smooth, comfortable ride. Camper Special and Super Camper Special packages would eventually extend to include F-350 pickups and were available through the 1979 model year.</p>","<p>The appeal and popularity of recreational camping has continued to grow in the years since the Camper Special, with our National Park System growing to more than 85 million acres and self-identified “active campers” in the U.S. totaling more than 20 million in 2023.</p>","<p>Ford enthusiasts today have a variety of exciting and capable options to enjoy the great outdoors, whether they off-road in their Bronco, tow their travel trailer with an F-Series pickup, or pack their Explorer for a long road trip.</p>","<p><i>Leslie Armbruster is the archives manager at Ford.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/ford-and-the-great-outdoors-celebrating-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-camper-special/ford-and-the-great-outdoors-celebrating-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-camper-special","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:business-unit/heritage-vault","fordmediasite:vehicle-models"]},":type":"fordmediasite/components/articlecard","dataLayer":{"articlecard-16e5dd4070":{"@type":"fordmediasite/components/articlecard","repo:modifyDate":"2025-09-18T14:06:27Z"}}},"article_secondary_one":{"id":"articlecard-cd3bc16a91","articleFragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/retired-police-officer-buys-an-electric-vehicle,-finds-tiktok-stardom/retired-police-officer-buys-an-electric-vehicle,-finds-tiktok-stardom","article":{"title":"Lisa Bought Her First Electric Vehicle.

Her days were defined by duty and a Ford she could always rely on.</p>","<p>Today, she’s become an unexpected new voice in one of the fastest-growing communities online. With millions of views on her TikTok videos, Lisa is a go-to source for people curious about life with an electric vehicle.</p>","<p>I sat down with her to hear her story.</p>","<h3>Your videos have become incredibly popular. What first inspired you to start creating content about your Mustang Mach-E®?</h3>","<p>Holland: It all started in parking lots. Soon after bringing home my car, I found that a simple trip to the grocery store often turned into an impromptu Q&amp;A session. I cannot tell you how many people would come up to me either with positive or negative comments. People were just asking me all sorts of questions, and I was dispelling all their misconceptions about the car. I realized I could answer these questions on a larger scale, so I decided to jump onto TikTok.</p>","<h3>What's the most common question or misconception you've had to dispel?</h3>","<p>Charge times. A lot of people think when I’m traveling on road trips that they could get there 3 hours earlier because they have a gas car. You know, that’s not true because once I factor in the stops I would already be making, it doesn’t add all that much extra time. And I wake up to a “full tank” when charging at home anyway.</p>","<h3>Several of your posts are directly responding to criticisms or misconceptions. What's the reaction been like when interacting with the EV skeptical?</h3>","<p>People still have questions about electric vehicles on TikTok, and sometimes I play along. I’m never really mean to anybody, but I try to get a little snarky and have fun with them. Some people apologize for saying nasty comments after I respond back nicely to them or in a funny way.</p>","<h3>You’ve had some amazing success, with one video hitting over three million views. What was that one about?</h3>","<p>It’s funny, the most popular ones are often the simplest. In that video, I just narrated my walk toward my car on an Atlanta street. As I approached, the vehicle recognized me, the lights flashed in welcome, and I opened the door to the distinct startup chime. It’s a moment of modern connection between driver and vehicle, and for some reason, it captivated millions.</p>","<h3>Let’s go back a bit. What led you to choose an electric vehicle in the first place?</h3>","<p>My fascination with electric vehicles began years ago after test-driving an early electric model. I found it fun and zippy, but the limited range and unconventional styling weren't quite right for me. For years, I kept an eye on the evolving technology, waiting for a vehicle that blended thrilling performance with practical design and affordability.</p>","<h3>And the Mustang Mach-E was the one that finally checked all the boxes?</h3>","<p>Yes. I was obsessed when I saw this car. Unlike other electric models I felt were becoming ubiquitous, the Mustang Mach-E stood out with its unique colors and classic car-like interior. That was important to me. People that come in my car and sit in the car have no idea that it's all electric because it looks like a normal car.</p>","<h3>Beyond the design, what has the day-to-day ownership experience been like?</h3>","<p>The practicality sealed the deal, and the financial benefits became clear almost immediately. There are no oil changes and minimal maintenance. That, combined with the convenience of charging at home, meant the savings were substantial for me when compared to driving my previous gas vehicle.Many electric utilities offer reduced rates for charging during off-peak hours, so it's much cheaper than a trip to the gas station. For me, the ability to \"fill up\" overnight in my garage is a game-changer.</p>","<h3>It’s incredible that you’re now inspiring others. What’s it like knowing your videos are having a real impact?</h3>","<p> It’s the best part. Followers frequently send messages telling me they bought a Mustang Mach-E because of my posts and instructional videos. And it’s been a personal benefit, too. My newfound video editing skills have even become an asset in my day job, where I now create videos for the District Attorney's office.</p>","<h3>Finally, with all this success, what keeps you motivated to keep posting?</h3>","<p>From the beginning, my goal was simple: to be informative and correct the myths I kept hearing. That’s how it started, and that’s what I still love to do.</p>","<p><i>Emily Gabler writes for Ford Motor Company about electric vehicles, customer experience, and community.</i></p>","<p><i></i></p>","<p><i><sup>1</sup>Estimated fuel savings are based on comparison between 2025 Mustang Mach-E® Select with extended-range battery and eAWD with an EPA-est. combined consumption rate of 32 kWh/100 miles and 2025 Ford Escape 2.0L AWD with an EPA-est. combined rating of 26 MPG and a driving range of 408 miles.

But when the company was incorporated in 1903, the initial headquarters was located on Mack Avenue, where the first Model A was assembled. A replica of that building has actually been on display for decades to visitors of Dearborn’s Greenfield Village!</p>","<p>We quickly outgrew that building, and the company moved to the larger Piquette Avenue Ford Plant, where we began to produce the different “alphabet” cars. The famous Model T was conceived as a skunkworks project in a secret room on the third floor, and thousands were produced as America fell in love with the Tin Lizzy. The Piquette Avenue Ford Plant is still standing and operates as a museum, telling the story of early automobile production and the development of the Model T.</p>","<p>From Piquette, we moved to Highland Park where construction on the site began in 1908, and vehicle production began in 1910. Designed by noted industrial architect Albert Kahn, Highland Park was nicknamed “The Crystal Palace” because of the extensive use of windows for lighting. With the development of the modern assembly line, production soared, and thousands of Model Ts were assembled each day.</p>","<p>Following the construction of the Rouge plant, management moved to the Administration Building off Schaeffer Road in 1928. With the famous Rotunda building adjacent and the mighty Rouge nearby, this was the seat of power for Ford Motor Company. One interesting fact that I learned about this building was that it even had a vegetable storage area!</p>","<p>Ford is often credited with opening the roads of America via the Model T, so as we celebrated our 50th anniversary in 1953, we used the slogan, “Fifty Years Forward on the American Road.”</p>","<p>In fact, when the “Glass House” was opened a few years later 1956, we made the street address “The America Road” to celebrate our role in American culture. We were not required to have a street number because it was the only building on the street! That changed when the Ford Credit building was built, and we received the address we have today: One American Road.</p>","<p>That address will follow us to the Hub. With more than 2 million square feet of space, our designers will continue to develop products that will keep the American Road open for decades to come.</p>","<p><i>Ted Ryan is heritage brand manager

This isn't just about expanding our reach; it's about deepening our impact and truly integrating the full power of Ford into the fabric of communities worldwide.</p>","<p>As part of this global expansion, we are initiating several key programs that leverage our unique strengths:</p>","<ul>\n <li><b>Transforming Dealerships into Food Drive Hubs: </b>With 1 in 11 people worldwide facing hunger,<sup>1</sup> our global dealer network is stepping up. Through the end of September, Ford dealerships in more than 30 countries are inviting customers and employees to donate non-perishable items. Each food drive is carefully curated for local communities, stocking shelves and pantries with items like grains, vegetables, or hygiene products most needed by local food bank recipients.<br><br></li>\n <li><b>Partnering with World Central Kitchen: </b>We are proud to welcome World Central Kitchen as a key nonprofit partner for global disaster relief. This partnership builds on past collaborations, from aiding Valencia flood victims to delivering meals after U.S. Hurricanes Ian and Fiona. Ford is donating three F-150s and a Super Duty F-350 to World Central Kitchen’s fleet, combining our logistics and community reach with their culinary expertise for rapid food aid delivery.<br><br></li>\n <li><b>Supporting Local Nonprofit Partners Globally:</b> Ford Philanthropy is providing new funding to local nonprofit organizations for disaster relief and preparedness efforts. This includes supporting the Red Cross’ community resilience efforts in Canada and Australia, disaster preparedness and response programming through the AIP Foundation in Vietnam, youth education and technological training efforts with Rede Cidada in Brazil and AIPC Pandora in Spain, and strengthening food security for families with the Felix Project in the United Kingdom, ensuring our assistance is both far-reaching and deeply rooted in local needs.<br><br></li>\n <li><b>Activating the Ford Volunteer Corps Around the World: </b>As part of Ford Philanthropy's Global Caring Month, over 6,000 Ford employees are participating in more than 180 volunteer projects across 30 countries. This employee-led initiative supports diverse causes, from youth programs to environmental education and disaster preparedness. To make it even easier for employees to participate all year long, the Ford Volunteer Corps Hub, our centralized volunteer sign-up platform, is launching in nine new global markets, connecting 63,000 employees with opportunities.</li>\n</ul>","<h3>Our Collective Impact</h3>","<p>As a family company, Ford has been driven by strong values and a deep commitment to service and philanthropy, values shared by our employees and dealers, since day one. Bringing the full power of Ford to support communities will ensure we are collectively working together to have an even bigger impact in communities into the future.</p>","<p><i><sup>1</sup>https://www.who.int/news/item/28-07-2025-global-hunger-declines-but-rises-in-africa-and-western-asia-un-report</i></p>","<p></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/ford-building-together-global-announcement/ford-building-together--supporting-communities-around-the-world","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:community","fordmediasite:community/ford-building-together"]},":type":"fordmediasite/components/articlecard","dataLayer":{"articlecard-a15cfe85ce":{"@type":"fordmediasite/components/articlecard","repo:modifyDate":"2025-09-18T14:06:27Z"}},"cq:panelTitle":"ford charge"},"item_1738808059692":{"id":"articlecard-cd3fc1644f","articleFragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/see-how-a-clay-model-brings-fords-new-world-headquarters-to-life-/see-how-a-clay-model-brings-fords-new-world-headquarters-to-life","article":{"title":"See How a Clay Model Brings Ford’s New World Headquarters to Life","featuredImage":{"altText":"Lead Clay Sculptor Jeff Royer (right), Clay Sculptor Sean VandenBrink (left), and Lead Sculptor Anna Burke stand with the completed clay model of the new World Headquarters building, a project five weeks in the making that involved a total of more than 30 Ford team members.

The diverse creative backgrounds of the trio who led the project, which includes work in ceramics and architecture, helped guide their work as they transformed the new WHQ into another medium.</p>","<h3><b>Designed for designers</b></h3>","<p>The project, and the material used to create it, reflects the makeup of many of the building’s residents. The New WHQ will house an expected six studios and a first-floor fabrication department for painting and rapid prototyping, as well as wood, metal and trim creation.</p>","<p>“It’s a very human-centered space,” said lead clay sculptor Jeff Royer, who added that the miniature World Headquarters would serve as an excellent wayfinding tool for the real-life space, which sits on the site of the former Product Development Center (PDC). “One thing that’s very clear is the quality of light from the natural lighting in the studios. That’s something we’re not used to from the old PDC.”</p>","<p>Lead sculptor Anna Burke has been working at the New WHQ since spring, giving her a front-row seat as it has been nearing completion.</p>","<p>“It’s been really exciting, and each week or month things change, and more hallways are opened up or more doors are finished or suddenly they remove some drywall and there’s a whole new bank of elevators,” she said, noting amenities like well-equipped focus rooms.</p>","<p>“It’s been an evolution and the amount of work and coordination across the board that’s gone into it is amazing.”</p>","<h3><b>Making the mold</b></h3>","<p>In creating the model, team members had to re-imagine the long-awaited new 2.1 million-square-foot space located at Oakwood Boulevard and Village Road in approximately 150 pounds of clay. The material is formed around a foam framework beneath.</p>","<p>The creation of the model was similar to vehicle clay models that many Ford team members are used to seeing. Typical clay models have a metal skeleton, plywood, and foam topped by a couple of inches of clay. Sean VandenBrink, one of the clay sculptors who worked on the WHQ model project, explained that clay is more of a moldable, wax-like substance than the name suggests.</p>","<p>“There was a lot of nice overlap to what our process is in terms of why we make three-dimensional cars rather than just relying on a sketch or an image,” he said. “Physical space helps you understand it in a different way, and that was definitely the case seeing this model and being able to be around it.</p>","<p>\"To see it in a space physically helps you catch a vision for what it’s going to be like.”</p>","<p>The team also took advantage of large-scale 3D printing capabilities available at the new World Headquarters to produce the detailed center courtyards of the model. Also, a custom wood table was built to support the creation.</p>","<h3><b>Tight turnaround</b></h3>","<p>The team leaned into the Ford OS behaviors: focus, excellence, and collaboration, to deliver the clay model project in just five weeks. Burke said they went the extra mile to deliver excellence, such as matching paints to the color of the clay for consistency.</p>","<p>“We don’t do anything halfway in the Fabrication and Modeling team,\" she said. \"We always try and bring it to the next level.”</p>","<p>Royer added that the phrase “good enough” is rarely used in their line of work.</p>","<p>Collaboration played a significant role in the project, including the work of the Ford Land Design team and construction partners who helped deliver the digital files of the building needed to kick off the design process. The clay modelers also worked with members of several other teams, including Digital Modeling, 3D Printing, as well as Clay and Foam Milling teams in turning what was once just 3D design files into their replica.</p>","<p>Burke noted that the model assignment gave its makers more creative freedom than a typical project, while Royer said he enjoyed the break from the norm and the support from management to enable the group’s artistic direction.</p>","<p>“It was an honor to be given the opportunity, and it was really fun,” he said. “It was really an eye-opening and different process. It was nice to have our day-to-day rhythm interrupted and changed in a new way. And I would imagine in some way, shape, or form, it influences work we do in the future on our own programs here within Ford.”</p>","<p><i>Paul Kampe writes for the Ford Communications team.</i></p>","<p></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/see-how-a-clay-model-brings-fords-new-world-headquarters-to-life-/see-how-a-clay-model-brings-fords-new-world-headquarters-to-life","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:corporate","fordmediasite:corporate/facilities"]},":type":"fordmediasite/components/articlecard","dataLayer":{"articlecard-cd3fc1644f":{"@type":"fordmediasite/components/articlecard","repo:modifyDate":"2025-09-18T14:06:27Z"}},"cq:panelTitle":"lightning stx"},"article_4":{"id":"articlecard-ea8c3d1c4e","articleFragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/introducing-the-new-ford-world-headquarters/introducing-the-new-ford-world-headquarters","article":{"title":"Introducing the New Ford World Headquarters","featuredImage":{"altText":"The state-of-the-art Dearborn campus is designed to consolidate design, engineering, and corporate leadership to foster enhanced collaboration and accelerate innovation.

We are proud to announce a new Ford World Headquarters will be at the heart of our upgraded and reimagined Dearborn product development campus, the new Henry Ford II World Center.</p>","<p>This is more than just a new building; it’s a catalyst for innovation and a physical symbol of our Ford+ transformation. To win in this new era, we must work more closely together than ever before.</p>","<p>Our new headquarters is designed to make that happen, bringing thousands of our engineering, design, and technology team members together in one collaborative space – twice the size of our current HQ, and built to accommodate double the employees – to innovate and solve problems faster than ever before.</p>","<p>Our team is working hard to wrap construction as hundreds of employees are collaborating in the building already. While the majority of the facility will be complete this year, work will continue through 2027 on a final section of the site.</p>","<p>When that’s done, up to 4,000 people can work from our HQ with a total of 14,000 employees within a 15-minute walk of the new World Headquarters building, enabling greater collaboration in practice and proximity.</p>","<p>This is part of a larger investment in our people and our facilities across the globe. We are committed to providing employees with world-class workspaces, modern technology, and the best tools to do their life’s best work—from our global offices to our manufacturing floors. Our dealers around the world are likewise investing in their stores and service centers to elevate the customer experience.</p>","<p>For nearly 70 years, the iconic Glass House served as the nerve center of our global operations and we honor its incredible legacy. But the future of our industry demands a different kind of space – one that is more connected, more flexible, and built for the speed of a technology – and software-driven company.</p>","<p>As we continue to adapt our campus for the future, the Glass House will itself be transformed. Once our teams have vacated the building, it will be sustainably decommissioned and ultimately demolished over the course of roughly 18 months as we prepare to repurpose the site as an asset to our teams and our community.</p>","<p>We are working with the City of Dearborn on a plan for how the site can best serve our employees and neighbors, and we will have more to share about those plans later.</p>","<p>We will officially open our new World Headquarters this November, when all employees will be welcome to visit our new home to work, collaborate, or simply see the future for yourselves. We will also open the doors for public tours, sharing this new community landmark with our neighbors.</p>","<p>This is a pivotal moment.

With technologies such as machine learning and edge AI streamlining many complex tasks, there’s a critical need to equip the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/essential-economy-reinvesting-workers-who-keep-america-jim-farley-auyae/?trackingId=ou%2FckvPzQQSJma0D3g5BJQ%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Economy</a> — those industries and workers that keep the nation running, including construction, manufacturing, logistics, service, and energy — with new and innovative solutions to support the rapid growth and development of these sectors and beyond.</p>","<p>According to new research by Aspen Institute economist Luke Pardue, the link between new ideas and economic growth has weakened in manufacturing, construction, transportation, and related industries in recent decades.</p>","<p>For example, the number of patents issued can be a key indicator of new ideas and innovation. Issued patents in the manufacturing industry dropped from 78% in the 1970s to 42% by 2000 and 30% in 2010. Meanwhile, innovation has grown in white-collar industries such as information technology, where the share of patents has quadrupled from 3% to 12% over this period.</p>","<p><b>Striving for Simplicity</b></p>","<p>Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have long been a key engine of the U.S. economy that drives innovation, contributes to the country’s GDP, and fuels employment.

According to the <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/small-business-data-center\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a>, they employ nearly half (43.5%) of the American workforce.</p>","<p>It’s in our collective best interest to ensure these businesses have the technology and resources they need to thrive. A key theme I hear when I talk to our small-business customers is the need for simple, powerful tools that can eliminate complexity and scale with them over time. However, this sector remains underserved.</p>","<p>Pardue believes that innovations from America’s SMBs can play a significant role in driving long-term growth. The challenge: Many SMBs simply don't have enough people or the right resources — especially in terms of tools and technologies — needed to improve efficiency, productivity, and innovation.</p>","<p>The solution: innovative ecosystems that can reach more businesses and help them improve performance, productivity, and generate new ideas as they scale up.</p>","<p>Improving efficiency and productivity through technology to help business customers is nothing new for Ford Pro. Beginning in 2019, every Ford commercial vehicle has included an embedded modem, saving businesses valuable time, money, and effort by removing the need for aftermarket hardware on these vehicles.</p>","<p>Combined with Ford Pro’s Data Services and Telematics solutions, the modems provide business owners and fleet managers with real-time operational data on vehicle health, tire pressure, GPS location, driver performance, and other information crucial for keeping vehicles on the road and business moving forward. Today, there are nearly 12 million Ford commercial vehicles in service, and nearly 30% are connected via embedded modems. We expect that percentage to double by 2026.</p>","<p>Embedded modems are just the beginning.

It’s a response to a conversation, a fulfillment of a promise. For us, that’s <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2024/all-new-ford-expedition-fully-redesigned-for-families-with-big-l\" rel=\"nofollow\">the new Ford Expedition</a>. It all started not with blueprints, but with a simple, powerful idea: to create a vehicle that could truly be a partner for families leading big, busy, wonderful lives.</p>","<p>We noticed something in the world of big SUVs. So many felt like they were designed for just one person: the driver. We wanted to build something different. In a world of \"me\" vehicles, we envisioned a \"we\" vehicle — a space designed for connecting with the people that matter most to help create memories that last a lifetime.</p>","<p>And now, just a few months after the first new Expedition SUVs found their homes, we are seeing an incredible response. It feels less like a sales report and more like a celebration with our community. The results over the last few months show we're on the right path.</p>","<h3>Unprecedented Sales Growth</h3>","<p>Expedition sales rocketed up by 43.9%, reaching 31,298 vehicles sold. They accelerated even more in August, up 53.7%.</p>","<p>The Expedition contributed 40% of the entire large traditional SUV segment's growth in the second quarter. Our share of that segment is now 24.1%, a significant leap from 19% just last year.</p>","<p>In a milestone moment we haven't seen in more than five years, in Q2 the Expedition outsold its primary competitor, the Chevrolet Tahoe. What makes this even more special is that many of these new owners came to us from GM vehicles, a welcome we don’t take for granted.</p>","<p>This incredible momentum is fueled by a simple truth: The full-size SUV remains a cornerstone for American families. The segment is growing at more than twice the rate of the auto industry as a whole, and a significant portion of these buyers — about 35% — are millennials navigating the beautiful chaos of raising children. Our mission was to build the perfect vehicle for that exact journey.</p>","<h3>What Our New Owners Are Saying</h3>","<p>Hearing from our new owners truly brings this mission to life. Savannah Varney, a recent buyer, shared her joy with us:</p>","<p>\"We absolutely love our new Expedition! We needed a family vehicle for our two babies for both daily use as well as traveling with a double stroller,\" she said. \"It is the perfect size for a growing family and rides so comfortably. Not to mention the King Ranch has all the bells and whistles and truly feels like luxury!!\"</p>","<p>Audrey Barton, a new Expedition owner and influencer at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/organizedchaos4bus/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OrganizedChaos4bus</a>, said \"I was driving a Chevy Equinox previously. But our family of five — including a teenager, a 9-year-old and 1-year-old—had outgrown it. My husband mentioned the new Expedition might be able to store the kid’s gear with ease. There are so many features that I love... It hits all the marks. We have no complaints!\"</p>","<p>Stories like Savannah's and Audrey’s are exactly why we designed the Expedition. Their stories also demonstrate how Expedition brings in some of the youngest buyers of any vehicle in our Ford lineup.</p>","<h3>Our Dealers Report Overwhelming Demand</h3>","<p>And it’s not just our customers who are feeling the excitement; our dealer partners are seeing it firsthand in their showrooms. The demand has been so strong that our biggest challenge is keeping up. They tell us that these new Expeditions are barely hitting the lot before they’re claimed by eager families.</p>","<p>Kelly Summers from Bill Knight Ford in Tulsa, Oklahoma, put it perfectly: “Customer loves the design change, modern appearance and improved handling. The interior of the vehicle was an incredible transformation... Definitely a winner from Ford.”</p>","<p>Over at Bozard Ford in Florida, Jeff King is seeing specific models fly out the door.</p>","<p>“Tremor and the Active are the best sellers... The Expedition has got a lot of eyes to it and with the big screen it has a lot of flash.”</p>","<h3>Redesigned with Families in Mind</h3>","<p>This success is a direct reflection of the heart and soul our team poured into every detail of the redesign. We listened, we innovated, and we focused on what families truly need.</p>","<ul>\n <li>We started with a bold new design, wrapping a completely revamped, luxurious interior in a refreshed, confident exterior.</li>\n <li>We brought the <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2024/enhance-your-drive--introducing-the-all-new-ford-and-lincoln-dig\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Digital Experience</a> to life with a stunning new dash that features a 24-inch panoramic display and a 13.2-inch infotainment screen.</li>\n <li>We introduced the first-ever Ford Split Gate for ultimate family-friendly functionality in the rear cargo area.</li>\n <li>We infused it with advanced technology, including our updated <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/search-results?q=BlueCruise\" rel=\"nofollow\">BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system</a> and the seamless integration of Google Maps.</li>\n <li>We dedicated ourselves to improving ride comfort, making <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/2025-expedition-suspension-delivers-a-better-ride\" rel=\"nofollow\">significant changes to the suspension</a> for a smoother journey based on customer feedback.</li>\n <li>Under the hood, the powerful and efficient 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine delivers 400 horsepower and an available max towing capacity of up to 9,600 pounds1.</li>\n <li>We proudly introduced the first-ever Expedition Tremor model for those whose adventures begin where the pavement ends.</li>\n</ul>","<p><i>Dan Peake is Ford Blue Utilities Communications Manager.</i></p>","<p><i>*Max towing of 9,600 lbs. available on Expedition® 4x4 SUV without 24-inch wheels.

Mullen","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/RoNeisha Mullen.jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>September marks two national observances that highlight critical needs in communities across the country: Hunger Action Month® and National Preparedness Month. While each brings important attention to separate causes, their connection becomes especially evident during disasters, when access to food and basic resources is disrupted. In these moments, providing a meal can be one of the most immediate and impactful forms of support.</p>","<p>Few understand that connection better than Vince Davis, Senior Manager of Planning and Response at Feeding America®, a Ford Building Together partner and the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization. With more than 25 years in emergency management, Davis has responded to some of the country’s most devastating disasters, including wildfires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes.</p>","<p>“I’ve seen firsthand how a disaster can wipe away everything — homes, jobs, and a sense of normalcy,” Davis said. “But I’ve also seen how one meal can mark the beginning of rebuilding it all.”</p>","<h3><b>Building Resilient Communities Through Partnership</b></h3>","<p>Preparedness involves more than just having supplies. It includes systems, local and cultural knowledge, and partnerships. Feeding America’s collaboration with Ford Philanthropy is one example of how partnerships strengthen the network’s emergency response efforts. Through Ford Building Together, Ford dealers and employees are stepping in to support food banks during both day-to-day operations and in times of crisis.</p>","<p>This summer, following devastating flash floods in Texas, Ford employees worked with volunteers from the North Texas Food Bank to pack more than 45,000 pounds of food, creating over 40,000 meals for families in the region.</p>","<p>“I’m incredibly proud of the sheer resilience and unwavering dedication of our network of food banks,” Davis said. “And I’m also grateful for partners like Ford Philanthropy.”</p>","<p>“It’s a powerful reminder that our mission is a collective one,” he said. “It takes many hands — including yours — to ensure no one is alone in the face of disaster. With every meal we provide, we’re not just fighting hunger; we’re building up the strength and resilience of a community, one neighbor at a time.”</p>","<h3><b>When Hunger and Crisis Collide</b></h3>","<p>Every day, the Feeding America network of more than 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries and meal programs work directly in communities across the country to alleviate hunger. But when disaster strikes, many of those same food banks shift into emergency response mode, rapidly scaling up operations to provide critical food support to people in need.</p>","<p>“Our partner food banks are already part of the community’s fabric,” Davis said. “So, when disaster strikes, we're not just arriving on the scene; we're already there, ready to shift from daily hunger relief to immediate, life-sustaining support.”</p>","<p>As one of the nation’s largest disaster relief organizations, Feeding America plays a key role in disaster recovery by delivering critical meals to impacted communities and helping residents regain a sense of stability. Davis and the Disaster Services team at the national office serve as the coordination hub, leading the triage process, assessing local impact, and deploying support where it is needed most.</p>","<p>“My role is like that of an air traffic controller for the network,” Davis said. “We perform wellness checks to ensure staff and facilities are safe and well, assess community impacts, and coordinate resources that food banks need to respond effectively.”</p>","<h3><b>A Meal Is More Than Just Food</b></h3>","<p>In times of disaster, Davis points out, food provides more than physical nourishment. It helps people move forward.</p>","<p>“It’s the fuel that gives people the strength to search for loved ones, clean up debris, and start rebuilding their lives,” he said. “A meal is a moment of calm in the chaos, offering hope and a sense of normalcy that helps families who have suffered upheaval in their lives to regain their dignity.”</p>","<p>Feeding America’s work does not stop after the initial response. Partner food banks remain in the community long after the headlines fade, continuing to serve residents throughout the long road to recovery.</p>","<p>“A hurricane, tornado, or flood is more than a weather event for a food bank; it’s a direct threat to their core mission,” Davis said. Food banks need to remain open, serving neighbors long after the cameras and news trucks leave, because that’s what we do. That’s what the community needs.”</p>","<h3><b>Take Action This September</b></h3>","<p>As Hunger Action Month and National Preparedness Month shine a spotlight on food security and emergency readiness, Feeding America encourages individuals and organizations to get involved. Ford dealers across the U.S. and around the world are also engaging their communities through food drives and donation efforts. These initiatives support local food banks and pantries, including some in the Feeding America network, and offer customers and employees meaningful ways to get involved through Ford’s Building Together initiative. Each drive is tailored to local needs, collecting items like grains, vegetables, and hygiene products.</p>","<p>Find a participating dealer near you <a

middle of a historic transformation. Dynamic competition, new technologies, and ever-shifting consumer preferences are just a few of the challenges we’re facing. Not every brand is going to survive the next decade and meet the evolved needs of today’s customers.</p>","<p>For 122 years, Ford has always shown up for our customers and communities with a unique blend of grit, optimism, and resilience, consistently keeping an eye on the future. It's a history defined by our commitment to serving others, improving and empowering lives.</p>","<p>Today, we’re doubling down on that with Ready Set <i>Ford</i>™, our first new global campaign in over 15 years.</p>","<p>Ready Set <i>Ford</i> is more than a tagline. It’s a catalyst designed to help our customers reach their full potential and feel ready for anything. It’s our public commitment to you that our capability, our passion, and our innovation will match your own. And it's a signal of a new chapter for Ford, one filled with energy and excitement.</p>","<p>While the auto industry is increasingly defined by sameness and making cars that just get us from point A to B, Ford is re-committing to passion vehicles that bring out the best in human capability. Capability is what unites everything we build – from race cars to Bronco® SUVs to Raptor® vehicles and Fleet Management Software.</p>","<p>We've been listening intently to our customers — to their needs and challenges. This has led us to make three big, strategic decisions to modernize and re-energize the Ford brand for a new era, and we’re doing this by embracing our authentic strengths.</p>","<p>First, we are aligning our entire company around fundamental promises we make to every customer: Capability, Passion, Community, and Trust.</p>","<ul>\n <li>We lead with Capability, giving our customers the tools they need to get the job done and be ready for anything through our vehicles and technology.<br><br></li>\n <li>Our vehicles allow our customers to pursue their Passions, whether that's a Bronco taking you on an off-road adventure or cruising down a canyon in your Mustang®. We are also deepening our investments in motorsports — both on track and off-road.<br><br></li>\n <li>We’re deeply rooted in Community — showing up in the good times and bad. Our employees, dealers, and customers come together to drive philanthropic efforts and community programs worldwide, including through <a href=\"https://www.fordphilanthropy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Philanthropy</a> and our newest initiative alongside our dealers, Ford <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/building-together/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Building Together</a>.<br><br></li>\n <li>And we earn Trust as a family company guided by integrity and transparency. In 2008, we were the only OEM not to take the bailout; that was a clear demonstration of the lengths we will go to protect our people and our brand.</li>\n</ul>","<p>Second, we're making a fundamental shift from leading with our nameplates to leading with the customer lifestyles we serve. We've identified distinct lifestyles that Ford can credibly and uniquely support, and going forward, they will inform decisions throughout the company from product design to retail experience.</p>","<p>Lastly, we are committing to showcasing our most exciting and distinctive products, services, and experiences to rebuild aspiration and excitement for Ford. Too often, we’ve let our volume offerings define the brand and kept our most capable and passionate products for enthusiasts “in the know.” Going forward, we’ll lean into our best, including incorporating our leadership in motorsports and Ford Pro in our advertising, highlighting how our most passionate and capable products serve our customers.</p>","<p>We’re bringing these shifts to life with the new platform Ready Set <i>Ford</i>, the first external marketing expression of a transformation that has been years in the making. We are incredibly excited about this new direction, and we are confident that it will deepen our connection with customers for generations to come.</p>","<p>We believe people are more capable than they think — they just need a spark. Ford is here to be that spark!<br><br><i>Lisa Materazzo is global chief marketing officer, Ford Motor

late 1800s, with the establishment of Yellowstone as our first National Park in 1872, which was also the first year Arbor Day was celebrated.</p>","<p>The 1879 creation of the United States Geological Survey, and its ubiquitous topographic maps, allowed travelers to explore public lands with confidence. A desire to preserve and dedicate more land for the enjoyment of outdoor enthusiasts lead to the 1892 creation of the Sierra Club, followed in 1905 by the Audubon Society, whose primary focus on preserving bird habitats also benefitted campers.</p>","<p>During this era, expansion of railroads allowed adventurous folks to travel further afield along dedicated railways more easily, while the evolution of the automobile industry allowed more people than ever to chart their own path from increasingly cramped urban areas to unspoiled natural areas.</p>","<p>The Four Vagabonds — Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone, and John Burroughs — helped popularize car camping with their widely documented decade of outdoor trips beginning in 1915. One of the earliest camping organizations, the Tin Can Tourists, was founded in Florida in 1919, and many of its members traveled in customized Model T “Tin Lizzies” between Michigan and the Sunshine State.</p>","<p>Fast forward a few decades, to when Ford Motor Company used its long lineage of helping customers explore the great outdoors to offer its industry-first Camper Special package on 1965 F-100 and F-250 pickup trucks.

Her days were defined by duty and a Ford she could always rely on.</p>","<p>Today, she’s become an unexpected new voice in one of the fastest-growing communities online. With millions of views on her TikTok videos, Lisa is a go-to source for people curious about life with an electric vehicle.</p>","<p>I sat down with her to hear her story.</p>","<h3>Your videos have become incredibly popular. What first inspired you to start creating content about your Mustang Mach-E®?</h3>","<p>Holland: It all started in parking lots. Soon after bringing home my car, I found that a simple trip to the grocery store often turned into an impromptu Q&amp;A session. I cannot tell you how many people would come up to me either with positive or negative comments. People were just asking me all sorts of questions, and I was dispelling all their misconceptions about the car. I realized I could answer these questions on a larger scale, so I decided to jump onto TikTok.</p>","<h3>What's the most common question or misconception you've had to dispel?</h3>","<p>Charge times. A lot of people think when I’m traveling on road trips that they could get there 3 hours earlier because they have a gas car. You know, that’s not true because once I factor in the stops I would already be making, it doesn’t add all that much extra time. And I wake up to a “full tank” when charging at home anyway.</p>","<h3>Several of your posts are directly responding to criticisms or misconceptions. What's the reaction been like when interacting with the EV skeptical?</h3>","<p>People still have questions about electric vehicles on TikTok, and sometimes I play along. I’m never really mean to anybody, but I try to get a little snarky and have fun with them. Some people apologize for saying nasty comments after I respond back nicely to them or in a funny way.</p>","<h3>You’ve had some amazing success, with one video hitting over three million views. What was that one about?</h3>","<p>It’s funny, the most popular ones are often the simplest. In that video, I just narrated my walk toward my car on an Atlanta street. As I approached, the vehicle recognized me, the lights flashed in welcome, and I opened the door to the distinct startup chime. It’s a moment of modern connection between driver and vehicle, and for some reason, it captivated millions.</p>","<h3>Let’s go back a bit. What led you to choose an electric vehicle in the first place?</h3>","<p>My fascination with electric vehicles began years ago after test-driving an early electric model. I found it fun and zippy, but the limited range and unconventional styling weren't quite right for me. For years, I kept an eye on the evolving technology, waiting for a vehicle that blended thrilling performance with practical design and affordability.</p>","<h3>And the Mustang Mach-E was the one that finally checked all the boxes?</h3>","<p>Yes. I was obsessed when I saw this car. Unlike other electric models I felt were becoming ubiquitous, the Mustang Mach-E stood out with its unique colors and classic car-like interior. That was important to me. People that come in my car and sit in the car have no idea that it's all electric because it looks like a normal car.</p>","<h3>Beyond the design, what has the day-to-day ownership experience been like?</h3>","<p>The practicality sealed the deal, and the financial benefits became clear almost immediately. There are no oil changes and minimal maintenance. That, combined with the convenience of charging at home, meant the savings were substantial for me when compared to driving my previous gas vehicle.Many electric utilities offer reduced rates for charging during off-peak hours, so it's much cheaper than a trip to the gas station. For me, the ability to \"fill up\" overnight in my garage is a game-changer.</p>","<h3>It’s incredible that you’re now inspiring others. What’s it like knowing your videos are having a real impact?</h3>","<p> It’s the best part. Followers frequently send messages telling me they bought a Mustang Mach-E because of my posts and instructional videos. And it’s been a personal benefit, too. My newfound video editing skills have even become an asset in my day job, where I now create videos for the District Attorney's office.</p>","<h3>Finally, with all this success, what keeps you motivated to keep posting?</h3>","<p>From the beginning, my goal was simple: to be informative and correct the myths I kept hearing. That’s how it started, and that’s what I still love to do.</p>","<p><i>Emily Gabler writes for Ford Motor Company about electric vehicles, customer experience, and community.</i></p>","<p><i></i></p>","<p><i><sup>1</sup>Estimated fuel savings are based on comparison between 2025 Mustang Mach-E® Select with extended-range battery and eAWD with an EPA-est. combined consumption rate of 32 kWh/100 miles and 2025 Ford Escape 2.0L AWD with an EPA-est. combined rating of 26 MPG and a driving range of 408 miles.

But when the company was incorporated in 1903, the initial headquarters was located on Mack Avenue, where the first Model A was assembled. A replica of that building has actually been on display for decades to visitors of Dearborn’s Greenfield Village!</p>","<p>We quickly outgrew that building, and the company moved to the larger Piquette Avenue Ford Plant, where we began to produce the different “alphabet” cars. The famous Model T was conceived as a skunkworks project in a secret room on the third floor, and thousands were produced as America fell in love with the Tin Lizzy. The Piquette Avenue Ford Plant is still standing and operates as a museum, telling the story of early automobile production and the development of the Model T.</p>","<p>From Piquette, we moved to Highland Park where construction on the site began in 1908, and vehicle production began in 1910. Designed by noted industrial architect Albert Kahn, Highland Park was nicknamed “The Crystal Palace” because of the extensive use of windows for lighting. With the development of the modern assembly line, production soared, and thousands of Model Ts were assembled each day.</p>","<p>Following the construction of the Rouge plant, management moved to the Administration Building off Schaeffer Road in 1928. With the famous Rotunda building adjacent and the mighty Rouge nearby, this was the seat of power for Ford Motor Company. One interesting fact that I learned about this building was that it even had a vegetable storage area!</p>","<p>Ford is often credited with opening the roads of America via the Model T, so as we celebrated our 50th anniversary in 1953, we used the slogan, “Fifty Years Forward on the American Road.”</p>","<p>In fact, when the “Glass House” was opened a few years later 1956, we made the street address “The America Road” to celebrate our role in American culture. We were not required to have a street number because it was the only building on the street! That changed when the Ford Credit building was built, and we received the address we have today: One American Road.</p>","<p>That address will follow us to the Hub. With more than 2 million square feet of space, our designers will continue to develop products that will keep the American Road open for decades to come.</p>","<p><i>Ted Ryan is heritage brand manager and archivist at Ford.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/the-many-homes-of-ford-on-the-american-road-/the-many-homes-of-ford-on-the-american-road","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:corporate","fordmediasite:corporate/facilities","fordmediasite:business-unit/heritage-vault"]},{"title":"Essential Workers, Essential Tech: Bridging the Access Gap","featuredImage":{"altText":"Ford Pro Transforms Business with New Era of Connectivity","altTextMobile":"Ford Pro Transforms Business with New Era of Connectivity","tags":"telematics,productivity","tagsMobile":"telematics,productivity","description":"","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"Ford Pro Transforms Business with New Era of Connectivity","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":"","mobileContributor":"","mobileCreator":"","mobileRights":"","mobileTitle":"Ford Pro Transforms Business with New Era of Connectivity","mobileUsageTerms":"","mobileOwner":"","imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg","imgUrlMobile":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg","alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp"],"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-pro-transforms-business-with-new-era-of-connectivity/Ford Pro Telematics 2.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","imgWidth":8850,"imgHeight":5464,"mobileImgWidth":8850,"mobileImgHeight":5464,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":[]},"images":[],"description":"Insights from Aspen Institute economist Luke Pardue show how innovations from America’s SMBs can play a significant role in driving long-term growth.

With technologies such as machine learning and edge AI streamlining many complex tasks, there’s a critical need to equip the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/essential-economy-reinvesting-workers-who-keep-america-jim-farley-auyae/?trackingId=ou%2FckvPzQQSJma0D3g5BJQ%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essential Economy</a> — those industries and workers that keep the nation running, including construction, manufacturing, logistics, service, and energy — with new and innovative solutions to support the rapid growth and development of these sectors and beyond.</p>","<p>According to new research by Aspen Institute economist Luke Pardue, the link between new ideas and economic growth has weakened in manufacturing, construction, transportation, and related industries in recent decades.</p>","<p>For example, the number of patents issued can be a key indicator of new ideas and innovation. Issued patents in the manufacturing industry dropped from 78% in the 1970s to 42% by 2000 and 30% in 2010. Meanwhile, innovation has grown in white-collar industries such as information technology, where the share of patents has quadrupled from 3% to 12% over this period.</p>","<p><b>Striving for Simplicity</b></p>","<p>Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have long been a key engine of the U.S. economy that drives innovation, contributes to the country’s GDP, and fuels employment. As of 2025, the U.S. <a href=\"https://advocacy.sba.gov/2025/06/30/new-advocacy-report-shows-the-number-of-small-businesses-in-the-u-s-exceeds-36-million/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Small Business Administration</a> reports there are approximately 36.2 million small businesses in the United States. According to the <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/small-business-data-center\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a>, they employ nearly half (43.5%) of the American workforce.</p>","<p>It’s in our collective best interest to ensure these businesses have the technology and resources they need to thrive. A key theme I hear when I talk to our small-business customers is the need for simple, powerful tools that can eliminate complexity and scale with them over time. However, this sector remains underserved.</p>","<p>Pardue believes that innovations from America’s SMBs can play a significant role in driving long-term growth. The challenge: Many SMBs simply don't have enough people or the right resources — especially in terms of tools and technologies — needed to improve efficiency, productivity, and innovation.</p>","<p>The solution: innovative ecosystems that can reach more businesses and help them improve performance, productivity, and generate new ideas as they scale up.</p>","<p>Improving efficiency and productivity through technology to help business customers is nothing new for Ford Pro. Beginning in 2019, every Ford commercial vehicle has included an embedded modem, saving businesses valuable time, money, and effort by removing the need for aftermarket hardware on these vehicles.</p>","<p>Combined with Ford Pro’s Data Services and Telematics solutions, the modems provide business owners and fleet managers with real-time operational data on vehicle health, tire pressure, GPS location, driver performance, and other information crucial for keeping vehicles on the road and business moving forward. Today, there are nearly 12 million Ford commercial vehicles in service, and nearly 30% are connected via embedded modems. We expect that percentage to double by 2026.</p>","<p>Embedded modems are just the beginning. They open the door to a much broader range of Ford Pro capabilities designed to maximize uptime and reduce operating costs. Because we’re the automaker, data scientist, and software developer all rolled into one, our specialized ecosystem delivers robust, valuable benefits to businesses.</p>","<p>That ecosystem<b> </b>is fueled by data. Our Ford Pro Intelligence platform monitors and analyzes more than 1 billion data points per day from Ford commercial vehicles for business customers. It is the connective thread that links vehicles, hardware, parts, services, and software to more than 640 certified vehicle centers around the world. And it includes the world’s largest network of mobile service vans to simplify the repair process by servicing customers where they are.</p>","<p>The outcome is a cohesive experience that proactively helps our customers anticipate problems, make swift data-driven decisions, and boost efficiency. This complex behind-the-scenes work is made simple for customers to integrate into their tools and business processes, ensuring that they experience the greatest possible uptime and have vehicles that are always ready for the day’s jobs.</p>","<p>This commitment to maximizing uptime and operational readiness extends to addressing the specific needs of SMBs and tradespeople, often through strategic collaborations. Recognizing that getting powerful tools into their hands is paramount, a recent example is our collaboration with<a href=\"https://www.servicetitan.com/go/brand-page?bt=772547784226&amp;_bk=servicetitan&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=188508527241&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=servicetitan_ga_br_exact_ao_tis_v2_nav-bar-test&amp;utm_content=22988395603%7C188508527241%7C772547784226&amp;utm_term=kwd-327980337804&amp;keyword=servicetitan&amp;matchtype=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bt=772547784226&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22988395603&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACpko0lqXEKv9om9MRgBHlDjHly_-&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_fnFBhB0EiwAH_MfZmXrnfe2sgL2p_AyAtE67hlV1MpdR1-dLm4LMNpUivdbwANYF9lJzhoCcG8QAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow\"> ServiceTitan</a>, the leading software company developing tools to help vocational trades such as HVAC, plumbing, carpentry, construction, and agriculture manage job scheduling, dispatching, invoicing, payment processing, repair parts ordering, and much more.</p>","<p>We’re bringing our industry-leading solutions and deep vehicle data together with ServiceTitan’s industry-leading platform for a crucial Essential Economy segment: the field service industry, which, of course, includes many SMBs.

By avoiding costly downtime, reducing repair costs, and lowering the total cost of ownership (TCO), we are enabling them to put time and money back into other key areas of their businesses.</p>","<p><b>Looking Down the Road</b></p>","<p>Innovation has always been part of Ford’s heritage, from Henry Ford’s <a href=\"https://corporate.ford.com/articles/history/henry-fords-greatest-innovation-the-quadricycle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">invention of the quadricycle in 1896</a> to BlueCruise hands-free highway driving technology available for customers today. For many tradespeople and SMBs, a work vehicle is their most essential tool. Understanding this, our vehicles, software, and services are designed to help them make the most of it.</p>","<p>In the bigger picture, the Aspen Institute’s Pardue recommends that businesses, universities, and leaders join forces to improve America's innovation ecosystem by diversifying models and sources of R&amp;D funding, streamlining the process of commercializing new ideas, and creating more geographical innovation clusters like those in the Bay Area, Boston, and New York City.</p>","<p>We believe in specializing products and services for a diverse range of businesses and making these solutions more accessible.

The diverse creative backgrounds of the trio who led the project, which includes work in ceramics and architecture, helped guide their work as they transformed the new WHQ into another medium.</p>","<h3><b>Designed for designers</b></h3>","<p>The project, and the material used to create it, reflects the makeup of many of the building’s residents. The New WHQ will house an expected six studios and a first-floor fabrication department for painting and rapid prototyping, as well as wood, metal and trim creation.</p>","<p>“It’s a very human-centered space,” said lead clay sculptor Jeff Royer, who added that the miniature World Headquarters would serve as an excellent wayfinding tool for the real-life space, which sits on the site of the former Product Development Center (PDC). “One thing that’s very clear is the quality of light from the natural lighting in the studios. That’s something we’re not used to from the old PDC.”</p>","<p>Lead sculptor Anna Burke has been working at the New WHQ since spring, giving her a front-row seat as it has been nearing completion.</p>","<p>“It’s been really exciting, and each week or month things change, and more hallways are opened up or more doors are finished or suddenly they remove some drywall and there’s a whole new bank of elevators,” she said, noting amenities like well-equipped focus rooms.</p>","<p>“It’s been an evolution and the amount of work and coordination across the board that’s gone into it is amazing.”</p>","<h3><b>Making the mold</b></h3>","<p>In creating the model, team members had to re-imagine the long-awaited new 2.1 million-square-foot space located at Oakwood Boulevard and Village Road in approximately 150 pounds of clay. The material is formed around a foam framework beneath.</p>","<p>The creation of the model was similar to vehicle clay models that many Ford team members are used to seeing. Typical clay models have a metal skeleton, plywood, and foam topped by a couple of inches of clay. Sean VandenBrink, one of the clay sculptors who worked on the WHQ model project, explained that clay is more of a moldable, wax-like substance than the name suggests.</p>","<p>“There was a lot of nice overlap to what our process is in terms of why we make three-dimensional cars rather than just relying on a sketch or an image,” he said. “Physical space helps you understand it in a different way, and that was definitely the case seeing this model and being able to be around it.</p>","<p>\"To see it in a space physically helps you catch a vision for what it’s going to be like.”</p>","<p>The team also took advantage of large-scale 3D printing capabilities available at the new World Headquarters to produce the detailed center courtyards of the model. Also, a custom wood table was built to support the creation.</p>","<h3><b>Tight turnaround</b></h3>","<p>The team leaned into the Ford OS behaviors: focus, excellence, and collaboration, to deliver the clay model project in just five weeks. Burke said they went the extra mile to deliver excellence, such as matching paints to the color of the clay for consistency.</p>","<p>“We don’t do anything halfway in the Fabrication and Modeling team,\" she said. \"We always try and bring it to the next level.”</p>","<p>Royer added that the phrase “good enough” is rarely used in their line of work.</p>","<p>Collaboration played a significant role in the project, including the work of the Ford Land Design team and construction partners who helped deliver the digital files of the building needed to kick off the design process. The clay modelers also worked with members of several other teams, including Digital Modeling, 3D Printing, as well as Clay and Foam Milling teams in turning what was once just 3D design files into their replica.</p>","<p>Burke noted that the model assignment gave its makers more creative freedom than a typical project, while Royer said he enjoyed the break from the norm and the support from management to enable the group’s artistic direction.</p>","<p>“It was an honor to be given the opportunity, and it was really fun,” he said. “It was really an eye-opening and different process. It was nice to have our day-to-day rhythm interrupted and changed in a new way. And I would imagine in some way, shape, or form, it influences work we do in the future on our own programs here within Ford.”</p>","<p><i>Paul Kampe writes for the Ford Communications

Mullen","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/RoNeisha Mullen.jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>September marks two national observances that highlight critical needs in communities across the country: Hunger Action Month® and National Preparedness Month. While each brings important attention to separate causes, their connection becomes especially evident during disasters, when access to food and basic resources is disrupted. In these moments, providing a meal can be one of the most immediate and impactful forms of support.</p>","<p>Few understand that connection better than Vince Davis, Senior Manager of Planning and Response at Feeding America®, a Ford Building Together partner and the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization. With more than 25 years in emergency management, Davis has responded to some of the country’s most devastating disasters, including wildfires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes.</p>","<p>“I’ve seen firsthand how a disaster can wipe away everything — homes, jobs, and a sense of normalcy,” Davis said. “But I’ve also seen how one meal can mark the beginning of rebuilding it all.”</p>","<h3><b>Building Resilient Communities Through Partnership</b></h3>","<p>Preparedness involves more than just having supplies. It includes systems, local and cultural knowledge, and partnerships. Feeding America’s collaboration with Ford Philanthropy is one example of how partnerships strengthen the network’s emergency response efforts. Through Ford Building Together, Ford dealers and employees are stepping in to support food banks during both day-to-day operations and in times of crisis.</p>","<p>This summer, following devastating flash floods in Texas, Ford employees worked with volunteers from the North Texas Food Bank to pack more than 45,000 pounds of food, creating over 40,000 meals for families in the region.</p>","<p>“I’m incredibly proud of the sheer resilience and unwavering dedication of our network of food banks,” Davis said. “And I’m also grateful for partners like Ford Philanthropy.”</p>","<p>“It’s a powerful reminder that our mission is a collective one,” he said. “It takes many hands — including yours — to ensure no one is alone in the face of disaster. With every meal we provide, we’re not just fighting hunger; we’re building up the strength and resilience of a community, one neighbor at a time.”</p>","<h3><b>When Hunger and Crisis Collide</b></h3>","<p>Every day, the Feeding America network of more than 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries and meal programs work directly in communities across the country to alleviate hunger. But when disaster strikes, many of those same food banks shift into emergency response mode, rapidly scaling up operations to provide critical food support to people in need.</p>","<p>“Our partner food banks are already part of the community’s fabric,” Davis said. “So, when disaster strikes, we're not just arriving on the scene; we're already there, ready to shift from daily hunger relief to immediate, life-sustaining support.”</p>","<p>As one of the nation’s largest disaster relief organizations, Feeding America plays a key role in disaster recovery by delivering critical meals to impacted communities and helping residents regain a sense of stability. Davis and the Disaster Services team at the national office serve as the coordination hub, leading the triage process, assessing local impact, and deploying support where it is needed most.</p>","<p>“My role is like that of an air traffic controller for the network,” Davis said. “We perform wellness checks to ensure staff and facilities are safe and well, assess community impacts, and coordinate resources that food banks need to respond effectively.”</p>","<h3><b>A Meal Is More Than Just Food</b></h3>","<p>In times of disaster, Davis points out, food provides more than physical nourishment. It helps people move forward.</p>","<p>“It’s the fuel that gives people the strength to search for loved ones, clean up debris, and start rebuilding their lives,” he said. “A meal is a moment of calm in the chaos, offering hope and a sense of normalcy that helps families who have suffered upheaval in their lives to regain their dignity.”</p>","<p>Feeding America’s work does not stop after the initial response. Partner food banks remain in the community long after the headlines fade, continuing to serve residents throughout the long road to recovery.</p>","<p>“A hurricane, tornado, or flood is more than a weather event for a food bank; it’s a direct threat to their core mission,” Davis said. Food banks need to remain open, serving neighbors long after the cameras and news trucks leave, because that’s what we do. That’s what the community needs.”</p>","<h3><b>Take Action This September</b></h3>","<p>As Hunger Action Month and National Preparedness Month shine a spotlight on food security and emergency readiness, Feeding America encourages individuals and organizations to get involved. Ford dealers across the U.S. and around the world are also engaging their communities through food drives and donation efforts. These initiatives support local food banks and pantries, including some in the Feeding America network, and offer customers and employees meaningful ways to get involved through Ford’s Building Together initiative. Each drive is tailored to local needs, collecting items like grains, vegetables, and hygiene products.</p>","<p>Find a participating dealer near you <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/building-together-volunteer-opportunities\" rel=\"nofollow\">on our volunteer map</a>, and learn more about Hunger Action Month at <a href=\"https://www.FeedingAmerica.org/HungerAction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Feeding America's website</a>.</p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/on-the-front-lines-of-hunger-and-disaster/on-the-front-lines-of-hunger-and-disaster","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:community","fordmediasite:community/ford-philanthropy","fordmediasite:community/ford-building-together","fordmediasite:community/feeding-america"]},{"title":"Introducing: Ready Set Ford","featuredImage":{"altText":"Ready Set Ford Logo","altTextMobile":"Ready Set Ford Logo","tags":"","tagsMobile":"","description":"","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"Ready Set Ford Logo","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":"","mobileContributor":"","mobileCreator":"","mobileRights":"","mobileTitle":"Ready Set Ford Logo","mobileUsageTerms":"","mobileOwner":"","imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg","imgUrlMobile":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo_mobile.jpeg","alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo_mobile.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo_mobile.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp"],"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo_mobile.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo_mobile.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo_mobile.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo_mobile.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford/ready_set_ford_logo.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","imgWidth":1920,"imgHeight":1080,"mobileImgWidth":1080,"mobileImgHeight":1920,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":[]},"images":[],"description":"Our first new global campaign in over 15 years doubles down on our history of commitment to serving others, and improving and empowering lives.","tag":"Company News","tags":[{"title":"Company News","name":"fordmediasite:corporate"}],"cta":{"href":"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/introducing-ready-set-ford","optionalClassName":null,"ariaLabel":"Introducing Ready Set Ford","label":"Introducing Ready Set Ford","target":"_self","icon":null,"csr":true},"date":1757516400000,"publishedDate":"2025-09-10","modifiedDate":"2025-09-09 23:58:06-0400","author":{"fullName":"Lisa Materazzo","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/Lisa-20Materazzo.jpg"},"paragraphs":["<p>It's no secret that our industry is in the middle of a historic transformation. Dynamic competition, new technologies, and ever-shifting consumer preferences are just a few of the challenges we’re facing. Not every brand is going to survive the next decade and meet the evolved needs of today’s customers.</p>","<p>For 122 years, Ford has always shown up for our customers and communities with a unique blend of grit, optimism, and resilience, consistently keeping an eye on the future. It's a history defined by our commitment to serving others, improving and empowering lives.</p>","<p>Today, we’re doubling down on that with Ready Set <i>Ford</i>™, our first new global campaign in over 15 years.</p>","<p>Ready Set <i>Ford</i> is more than a tagline. It’s a catalyst designed to help our customers reach their full potential and feel ready for anything. It’s our public commitment to you that our capability, our passion, and our innovation will match your own. And it's a signal of a new chapter for Ford, one filled with energy and excitement.</p>","<p>While the auto industry is increasingly defined by sameness and making cars that just get us from point A to B, Ford is re-committing to passion vehicles that bring out the best in human capability. Capability is what unites everything we build – from race cars to Bronco® SUVs to Raptor® vehicles and Fleet Management Software.</p>","<p>We've been listening intently to our customers — to their needs and challenges. This has led us to make three big, strategic decisions to modernize and re-energize the Ford brand for a new era, and we’re doing this by embracing our authentic strengths.</p>","<p>First, we are aligning our entire company around fundamental promises we make to every customer: Capability, Passion, Community, and Trust.</p>","<ul>\n <li>We lead with Capability, giving our customers the tools they need to get the job done and be ready for anything through our vehicles and technology.<br><br></li>\n <li>Our vehicles allow our customers to pursue their Passions, whether that's a Bronco taking you on an off-road adventure or cruising down a canyon in your Mustang®. We are also deepening our investments in motorsports — both on track and off-road.<br><br></li>\n <li>We’re deeply rooted in Community — showing up in the good times and bad. Our employees, dealers, and customers come together to drive philanthropic efforts and community programs worldwide, including through <a href=\"https://www.fordphilanthropy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Philanthropy</a> and our newest initiative alongside our dealers, Ford <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/building-together/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Building Together</a>.<br><br></li>\n <li>And we earn Trust as a family company guided by integrity and transparency. In 2008, we were the only OEM not to take the bailout; that was a clear demonstration of the lengths we will go to protect our people and our brand.</li>\n</ul>","<p>Second, we're making a fundamental shift from leading with our nameplates to leading with the customer lifestyles we serve. We've identified distinct lifestyles that Ford can credibly and uniquely support, and going forward, they will inform decisions throughout the company from product design to retail experience.</p>","<p>Lastly, we are committing to showcasing our most exciting and distinctive products, services, and experiences to rebuild aspiration and excitement for Ford. Too often, we’ve let our volume offerings define the brand and kept our most capable and passionate products for enthusiasts “in the know.” Going forward, we’ll lean into our best, including incorporating our leadership in motorsports and Ford Pro in our advertising, highlighting how our most passionate and capable products serve our customers.</p>","<p>We’re bringing these shifts to life with the new platform Ready Set <i>Ford</i>, the first external marketing expression of a transformation that has been years in the making. We are incredibly excited about this new direction, and we are confident that it will deepen our connection with customers for generations to come.</p>","<p>We believe people are more capable than they think — they just need a spark.

It’s a response to a conversation, a fulfillment of a promise. For us, that’s <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2024/all-new-ford-expedition-fully-redesigned-for-families-with-big-l\" rel=\"nofollow\">the new Ford Expedition</a>. It all started not with blueprints, but with a simple, powerful idea: to create a vehicle that could truly be a partner for families leading big, busy, wonderful lives.</p>","<p>We noticed something in the world of big SUVs. So many felt like they were designed for just one person: the driver. We wanted to build something different. In a world of \"me\" vehicles, we envisioned a \"we\" vehicle — a space designed for connecting with the people that matter most to help create memories that last a lifetime.</p>","<p>And now, just a few months after the first new Expedition SUVs found their homes, we are seeing an incredible response. It feels less like a sales report and more like a celebration with our community. The results over the last few months show we're on the right path.</p>","<h3>Unprecedented Sales Growth</h3>","<p>Expedition sales rocketed up by 43.9%, reaching 31,298 vehicles sold. They accelerated even more in August, up 53.7%.</p>","<p>The Expedition contributed 40% of the entire large traditional SUV segment's growth in the second quarter. Our share of that segment is now 24.1%, a significant leap from 19% just last year.</p>","<p>In a milestone moment we haven't seen in more than five years, in Q2 the Expedition outsold its primary competitor, the Chevrolet Tahoe. What makes this even more special is that many of these new owners came to us from GM vehicles, a welcome we don’t take for granted.</p>","<p>This incredible momentum is fueled by a simple truth: The full-size SUV remains a cornerstone for American families. The segment is growing at more than twice the rate of the auto industry as a whole, and a significant portion of these buyers — about 35% — are millennials navigating the beautiful chaos of raising children. Our mission was to build the perfect vehicle for that exact journey.</p>","<h3>What Our New Owners Are Saying</h3>","<p>Hearing from our new owners truly brings this mission to life. Savannah Varney, a recent buyer, shared her joy with us:</p>","<p>\"We absolutely love our new Expedition! We needed a family vehicle for our two babies for both daily use as well as traveling with a double stroller,\" she said. \"It is the perfect size for a growing family and rides so comfortably. Not to mention the King Ranch has all the bells and whistles and truly feels like luxury!!\"</p>","<p>Audrey Barton, a new Expedition owner and influencer at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/organizedchaos4bus/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OrganizedChaos4bus</a>, said \"I was driving a Chevy Equinox previously. But our family of five — including a teenager, a 9-year-old and 1-year-old—had outgrown it. My husband mentioned the new Expedition might be able to store the kid’s gear with ease. There are so many features that I love... It hits all the marks. We have no complaints!\"</p>","<p>Stories like Savannah's and Audrey’s are exactly why we designed the Expedition. Their stories also demonstrate how Expedition brings in some of the youngest buyers of any vehicle in our Ford lineup.</p>","<h3>Our Dealers Report Overwhelming Demand</h3>","<p>And it’s not just our customers who are feeling the excitement; our dealer partners are seeing it firsthand in their showrooms. The demand has been so strong that our biggest challenge is keeping up. They tell us that these new Expeditions are barely hitting the lot before they’re claimed by eager families.</p>","<p>Kelly Summers from Bill Knight Ford in Tulsa, Oklahoma, put it perfectly: “Customer loves the design change, modern appearance and improved handling. The interior of the vehicle was an incredible transformation... Definitely a winner from Ford.”</p>","<p>Over at Bozard Ford in Florida, Jeff King is seeing specific models fly out the door.</p>","<p>“Tremor and the Active are the best sellers... The Expedition has got a lot of eyes to it and with the big screen it has a lot of flash.”</p>","<h3>Redesigned with Families in Mind</h3>","<p>This success is a direct reflection of the heart and soul our team poured into every detail of the redesign. We listened, we innovated, and we focused on what families truly need.</p>","<ul>\n <li>We started with a bold new design, wrapping a completely revamped, luxurious interior in a refreshed, confident exterior.</li>\n <li>We brought the <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2024/enhance-your-drive--introducing-the-all-new-ford-and-lincoln-dig\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Digital Experience</a> to life with a stunning new dash that features a 24-inch panoramic display and a 13.2-inch infotainment screen.</li>\n <li>We introduced the first-ever Ford Split Gate for ultimate family-friendly functionality in the rear cargo area.</li>\n <li>We infused it with advanced technology, including our updated <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/search-results?q=BlueCruise\" rel=\"nofollow\">BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system</a> and the seamless integration of Google Maps.</li>\n <li>We dedicated ourselves to improving ride comfort, making <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/2025-expedition-suspension-delivers-a-better-ride\" rel=\"nofollow\">significant changes to the suspension</a> for a smoother journey based on customer feedback.</li>\n <li>Under the hood, the powerful and efficient 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine delivers 400 horsepower and an available max towing capacity of up to 9,600 pounds1.</li>\n <li>We proudly introduced the first-ever Expedition Tremor model for those whose adventures begin where the pavement ends.</li>\n</ul>","<p><i>Dan Peake is Ford Blue Utilities Communications Manager.</i></p>","<p><i>*Max towing of 9,600 lbs. available on Expedition® 4x4 SUV without 24-inch wheels.

America than any other electric truck<sup>1</sup>. In my role as F-150 Lightning marketing manager, I’ve been able to talk with many of our customers about what they like about their truck and what they wish it offered. Those insights, plus my own experience owning multiple F-150 Lightnings from Pro to Platinum since 2022, have given me a ton of inspiration for future updates.</p>","<p>These customer-driven updates were the catalyst for the introduction of the F-150 Lightning Flash for 2024; our value-packed, tech-forward truck that customers have loved. For 2026, the team and I have taken that same mindset and used it to revamp the XLT series into something new.</p>","<p>Customers have been asking for a rugged F-150 Lightning with more range than the standard range XLT. Until now, if these owners wanted a rugged F-150 Lightning, they had to turn to the aftermarket to build the truck they wanted. We wanted to meet them where they were, which is why we’re so excited about the new F-150 Lightning STX.</p>","<p>This series replaces the previous XLT and comes equipped with dual motors and an extended range battery, targeting an EPA-estimated 290 miles of range, 536 horsepower and 775 lb.-ft. of torque<i><sup>†</sup></i>, as well as a standard rear e-locking differential. Thanks to the commonality with our internal combustion sibling, we were able to raid the F-150 parts bin and utilize some of the most rugged options on F-150 Lightning. We’ve added the off-road running boards from F-150 Tremor and new to F-150 Lightning wheels and all-terrain tires.</p>","<p>The STX Series also adds a fresh new grille with a striking grabber blue accent, while STX-specific bedside and hood graphics visually differentiate it from the rest of the F-150 Lightning portfolio. On the inside, you’ll see new cloth “STX” Grabber Blue embroidered seats, as well as a standard heated steering wheel, which I’ve come to love during the long Michigan winters. A black vinyl floor is also optional for those who tend to get dirty.</p>","<p>I’m also excited about some of our new optional colors for 2026; Argon Blue, which you can see in our photos above and Marsh Gray, which I have personally ordered for my next truck, as well as Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat.

I hope you’ve all had a great summer (or winter for us Aussies) and are excited for the rest of 2025.</p>","<p>I wanted to write you all a quick note to coincide with some exciting news. While my racing days are behind me, my love for anything with wheels will always remain high, and for that I am proud to be partnering with Ford to become a Global Ford Racing Ambassador. I am going to be working closely with the Ford Racing team and specifically focus on the amazing Raptor brand and lifestyle that Raptor has become for many of Ford's customers.</p>","<p>So why now, and why me? When I decided it was time to retire, I thought long and hard about finding the most authentic way to stay connected to the world of motorsports. For me, racing was always about having fun. It made me happy and created memories that will last a lifetime.</p>","<p>I was thinking back to my core memories with Ford. First, when I purchased a Raptor back in 2017 before I even owned a home in the US. Priorities, am I right? Then, shortly after Ford announced it was partnering with Oracle Red Bull Racing, I came over to Dearborn and met senior leaders like Jim Farley (we had a ton of fun and a lot of laughs) but also had the chance to peek behind the curtain and see what was happening within your design department. Damn impressive. I then visited the team in Cologne later that summer and had a great time meeting employees, watching a live crash test, and answering questions in a Town Hall.</p>","<p>Throughout all these occasions, Ford and its employees' passion for motorsports was very apparent. But what excites me most is how you all continue to find ways of having fun while innovating. Ford has built a proper business around motorsport and is using it to bring new technologies to your road cars. And nothing brings that to life better than the beloved Raptor.</p>","<p>Taking my bias for “American-made” and deep love for trucks out of the equation, Raptor is becoming a global powerhouse. I’m one of thousands of happy customers. Some of my favourite memories are road tripping behind the wheel of my Raptor, and I can’t wait to add to my existing Raptor ownership, plus meet the customers who are equally passionate about their vehicles.</p>","<p>I couldn’t be more excited for all the amazing drives ahead with Ford and for all the incredible projects Ford Racing has in its pipeline. From F1 to Dakar and from Le Mans to Bathurst, few companies have been at this for as long as you guys have. From what I have seen, we have an incredible future ahead, and I am so proud to be joining the team.</p>","<p>So, here’s to the fun, the laughs, and the memories that lie ahead.</p>","<p>Daniel</p>","<p><i>Daniel Ricciardo is a Global Ford Racing Ambassador</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/daniel-ricciardo-becomes-global-ford-racing-ambassador/daniel-ricciardo-becomes-global-ford-racing-ambassador","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:motorsports"]},{"title":"The Modern Hunter’s Toolkit ","featuredImage":{"altText":"Owning an F-150 Lightning XLT aligns with Isaac and Michelle Turton’s two life passions — hunting and conservation.","altTextMobile":null,"tags":"","tagsMobile":null,"description":"Owning an F-150 Lightning XLT aligns with Isaac and Michelle Turton’s two life passions — hunting and conservation.","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":null,"mobileContributor":null,"mobileCreator":null,"mobileRights":null,"mobileTitle":null,"mobileUsageTerms":null,"mobileOwner":null,"imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg","imgUrlMobile":null,"alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":null,"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":null,"defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":null,"defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":null,"defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":null,"defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/social-media/Ford_ModernHuntersToolKit_20250830-100_v2.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":null,"imgWidth":5923,"imgHeight":3334,"mobileImgWidth":0,"mobileImgHeight":0,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":null},"images":[],"description":"Silent, powerful, and loaded with technology, the F-150 Lightning blends the capability hunters expect from a full-size truck with features designed for a more modern, efficient life in the outdoors.","tag":"F-150 Lightning","tags":[{"title":"F-150 Lightning","name":"fordmediasite:vehicle-models/f-150-lightning"},{"title":"Electric Vehicles","name":"fordmediasite:vehicle-types/electric-vehicles"},{"title":"Vehicles","name":"fordmediasite:vehicle-models"}],"cta":{"href":"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/f-150-lightning-hunting-toolkit","optionalClassName":null,"ariaLabel":"The Modern Hunter's Toolkit","label":"The Modern Hunter's Toolkit","target":"_self","icon":null,"csr":true},"date":1756998000000,"publishedDate":"2025-09-04","modifiedDate":"2025-09-03 17:05:10-0400","author":{"fullName":"Colin Steele","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/authors/author-images/Colin_Steele.jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>It was four o’clock on a midsummer morning — prime hog hunting hours. Jason Schneider made his usual rounds across several Central Texas properties where invasive wild pigs tear up the farmland. As he rolled to a stop at the edge of a field, he spotted nearly a dozen pigs rooting in the dirt.</p>","<p>Normally, the rumble of an engine would scatter the animals long before Schneider got close. But not in his electric truck.</p>","<p>“I was within 100 yards of pigs, and they had no idea I was there,” he recalled. “With my old truck, that never would have happened.”</p>","<p>Silent, powerful, and loaded with technology, the F-150 Lightning blends the capability hunters expect from a full-size truck with features designed for a more modern, efficient life in the outdoors. For Schneider and other hunters across the country, it’s proving that electric trucks can do far more than just commute.</p>","<h3>The Power of Quiet</h3>","<p>In Maryland, Isaac and Michelle Turton’s two life passions — hunting and conservation — are inseparable. The fees for their hunting licenses fund habitat preservation and wildlife management, and owning a 2024 F-150 Lightning XLT feels like another way to align their lifestyle with their values.</p>","<p>“It fits so well with our family, with the environment being important to us, and knowing that we're driving the truck with zero emissions,<sup>1</sup>” Michelle Turton said.</p>","<p>Like Schneider, the Turtons have also found the truck’s absence of engine noise to be a pleasant surprise both in the field and in everyday life. They appreciate being able to talk easily on long drives without raising their voices — even when one of them is sitting in the back with their young daughter.</p>","<p>“When you’ve got a baby and two dogs in the truck, the quiet makes the whole day feel calmer,” Michelle Turton said.</p>","<p>And during hot training sessions with their bird dogs, they idle in the field with the air conditioning running, which they never would have done with a loud gas engine.</p>","<p>Being able to quickly cool or heat the cabin after hours outdoors has also become a favorite feature for Kentucky hunter Tony Baudino.</p>","<p>“I can come out of the field frozen or sweaty, and in two minutes that truck has me comfortable again,” he said. “It feels like a little luxury in the middle of a hunt.”</p>","<h3>‘A Huge Difference’</h3>","<p>Hunters are rethinking how they pack and prepare thanks to the F-150 Lightning’s front trunk, also known as the frunk, which offers over 14 cubic feet of storage space and a 400-pound payload capacity. Baudino uses it to store dry clothes and warm his waders before heading into the water for duck and goose hunting. His dog has even been known to sprawl in the open frunk of the parked F-150 Lightning for shade, food, and water between training runs.</p>","<p>The frunk is also essential for Schneider’s pig hunting, where it carries thermal drones, scopes, and batteries. In addition, he relies on the F-150 Lightning’s Pro Power Onboard capabilities — including multiple power and USB outlets in the bed and frunk — to recharge that equipment while he moves between properties.</p>","<p>Baudino has powered an electric fillet knife to clean fish and run a fan for his dogs in the summer heat. And when storms knocked out power to his house for two full days, he ran an extension cord from his truck to his sump pump, to keep his basement from flooding, and to his refrigerator, so he didn’t lose groceries.</p>","<h3>Lightning Life</h3>","<p>Beyond hunting, the Ford F-150 Lightning is reshaping how these owners — and the people they meet on the road — think about trucks. On a recent road trip, Isaac Turton stopped to charge the F-150 Lightning and quickly drew a crowd.</p>","<p>“We had a half-dozen people come over just to ask about it,” he said. “Folks are curious, and once they hear how we actually use it — for hunting, for family trips — they realize it’s not just some commuter EV.”</p>","<p>These hunters have also found themselves dispelling myths. They all hear the same concerns, but their experiences tell a different story. Route planning is manageable with apps and coordination. Depending on the destination, charging can be done during a coffee stop with a 150+ kW charger.</p>","<p>Cost was a motivator for Baudino, who realized he could save money by charging his Lightning at his home compared to filling a gas tank of a similar pickup.</p>","<p>“I’ve put about 26,000 miles on it in just over a year, and at this point, I’ll probably never go back to a gas vehicle,” he said.</p>","<p>Most of all, these hunters have demonstrated that an electric truck can be viable well beyond city commutes. The Lightning hauls deer, carries muddy boots, and powers equipment — while still providing the quiet, efficiency, and comfort of a modern EV.</p>","<p>“We’re still doing everything we’ve always done: hunting, fishing, raising our daughter,” said Michelle Turton. “The Lightning just makes it all easier.”</p>","<p><i>Colin Steele is a From the Road contributor.</i></p>","<p><i><sup>1</sup>The 2024 and 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning® pickup is a zero emissions vehicle, based on EPA tailpipe rating.

href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2024/new-collaboration-to-deliver-electrification-blueprint-to-southe\" rel=\"nofollow\">six-month pilot program</a> to gain valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with managed charging for electric commercial fleet operations and its impact on the electric grid.<b></b></p>","<p>The pilot demonstrated how Southern Company can shift charging for its fleet into lower cost periods, respond to grid signals, and maintain operational readiness.<sup>1</sup> These learnings can help develop a framework to assist commercial customers with electrification at scale, inform future EV customer programs, and bolster energy reliability.</p>","<p><b>The Pilot</b></p>","<p>The pilot leveraged Southern Company’s more than 200 existing Ford F-150® Lightning® trucks and over 150 Level 2 AC Ford Pro Chargers at its subsidiaries. Ford Pro Intelligence monitored and analyzed data from vehicles and chargers, giving the company visibility into charging patterns and energy use.</p>","<p>With a diverse fleet that spans multiple states, Southern Company’s fleet operations provided the ideal testbed. The pilot showed how their large enterprise fleet could leverage managed charging capabilities to responsibly manage energy demands while ensuring their fleet drivers always have access to charging when and where they need it.</p>","<p><b>The Results:</b> <b>Energy Savings and Insights for Future Grid and Customer Benefits</b></p>","<p>Intelligent energy management played an important role during the 6-month pilot. For Southern Company, Ford Pro’s software became a strategic tool, allowing them to control when their chargers were available and to see the impact on energy usage when charging abilities were managed during specific peak-charging timeframes.</p>","<p>“Ford Pro’s energy management algorithm was able to throttle chargers to avoid windows of peak grid demand, shifting charging within the drivers’ existing charging window while still ensuring that drivers got the energy they expected out of a charging session,\" explained Tom Canada, fleet electrification project manager at Georgia Power, a Southern Company subsidiary. “The insights gleaned from this pilot represent valuable learnings that can be applied to help us manage our electric vehicle fleets more efficiently and help us better advise customers who may approach our electric utilities for advice about managed charging for their fleets.”</p>","<p>The impact was immediate. Ford Pro managed strategic demand response tests that leveraged its charging software to schedule charging pauses at specified times of high demand and peak pricing. Southern Company’s fleet maintained operational continuity throughout, demonstrating that dynamic fleet charging has the ability to respond to utility signals while protecting business-critical uptime.

Combined with the Ford Universal EV Platform, the system will enable Ford to deliver a new generation of affordable electric vehicles at scale, starting at the Louisville Assembly Plant.</p>","<p>Bryce Currie, Ford vice president of Americas manufacturing, answers questions about what this means for Ford assembly line workers at the Louisville plant ahead of the first vehicle launch in 2027.</p>","<h3>Q: How is the Universal EV Production System different from what Ford does today?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: Simply put, we’re transforming the traditional assembly line into an “assembly tree.” Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assemblies run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together. One sub-assembly is for the front of the vehicle, another for the rear, and the third for the structural battery, seats, consoles, and carpeting.</p>","<h3>Q: What makes the Universal EV Production System unique?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: We’re confident this is the first time a vehicle will be built like this anywhere in the world. We tore up the century-old concept of the moving assembly line, transforming it with three sub-assemblies and a process that presents the vehicle to operators as a kit. We put operators first, and we expect the ergonomic benefits of the Ford Universal EV Production System will flow through to cost and quality.</p>","<h3>Q: How much faster is the Universal EV Production System?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: The platform would allow us to assemble the new midsize electric truck 40% faster than Louisville Assembly Plant’s current products. We reinvested some of that time into insourcing and automation to improve quality and cost. That decision will give Louisville Assembly Plant the highest level of automation in final assembly across all Ford plants globally, and it means assembly of the midsize truck will ultimately net out at 15% faster than Louisville Assembly today.</p>","<h3>Q: How will the Universal EV Production System improve working conditions for employees?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: We listened to all the things operators don’t like. Safety is our top priority, consistent with what we hear from operators. The result is that their work at Louisville Assembly Plant will be significantly more ergonomic. It’s designed to require less twisting, turning, and bending.</p>","<h3>Q: What will make work on the assembly line more efficient and ergonomic?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: We want this to be the most efficient plant, assembling the most efficient product in the market. The vehicle arrives in front of the operator as a kit — with parts in the right orientation, and fasteners, scanners, and power tools included in the kit. This helps them focus and keep their eyes forward with limited stock behind them. We’ve engineered an 84% reduction in reaching over the fender, as one example. The wiring harness is also more than 4,000 feet shorter and 22 pounds lighter than in our first-gen electric SUV, making it much easier to install.</p>","<h3>Q: How does reducing manufacturing complexity improve vehicle quality?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: Less wasted movement means our employees can focus on quality. And complexity reduction will help with quality, too. We have 50% fewer connections, 50% fewer cooling hoses, and 20% fewer parts than a typical program. We’ve also eliminated Pre-Opened Pre-Positioned (POPP) clamps in favor of quick connects. It all means a lower risk of faulty connections. It’s going to be a big improvement.</p>","<h3>Q: Will Ford implement its Universal EV Production System at any other plants?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: We are focused on Louisville Assembly Plant first and making this project a success. Then we’ll determine how to take these learnings into our global manufacturing operations. We can test and learn at the leading edge, while we continue to run and refine the proven processes we’ve honed over 122 years.</p>","<h3>Q: What technology upgrades are happening at Louisville Assembly Plant?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: We know that only a high-tech plant can assemble a high-tech product. So, the digital infrastructure here will be significantly upgraded. Louisville Assembly will have the fastest network with the most access points out of any Ford plant globally — meaning we can do quality checks anywhere in final assembly. Network capability will be the latest-generation WiFi-7, which is more resilient and three times faster than what exists today, and we’re increasing the density of access points. On top of that, private 5G will help ensure reliable high-speed wireless communications for diagnostics and quality checks.</p>","<h3>Q: How much money is Ford investing in upgrading manufacturing at Louisville Assembly Plant?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: We plan to invest approximately $2 billion at Louisville Assembly Plant.</p>","<h3>Q: What is Ford’s commitment to the Louisville community beyond the factory walls?</h3>","<p>Bryce Currie: Since 2020, Ford and its employees have donated more than $8 million and volunteered more than 10,000 hours serving the state of Kentucky and our local communities. That doesn’t even include the impact of 48 dealers across the state, which employ 2,300 people. We’re securing the future of Louisville Assembly Plant with this new investment in manufacturing, enabling Ford and our employees to continue strengthening the Louisville community.</p>","<p><i>Lars Weborg is a member of the Ford Communications team.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/q-a-inside-the-new-ford-universal-ev-production-system-/q&a--inside-the-new-ford-universal-ev-production-system","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:vehicle-types/electric-vehicles","fordmediasite:vehicle-models","fordmediasite:corporate/manufacturing"]},{"title":"Our Name is Our Mission: Ford Racing is Back","featuredImage":{"altText":"Ford Racing Logo","altTextMobile":"Ford Racing Logo","tags":"motorsports","tagsMobile":"motorsports","description":"Ford Racing Logo","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"Ford Racing Logo","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":"Ford Racing Logo","mobileContributor":"","mobileCreator":"","mobileRights":"","mobileTitle":"Ford Racing Logo","mobileUsageTerms":"","mobileOwner":"","imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg","imgUrlMobile":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo-mobile.jpg","alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo-mobile.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo-mobile.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp"],"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo-mobile.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo-mobile.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo-mobile.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo-mobile.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/embracing-past-dynamic-new-future-ford-racing/ford-racing-logo.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","imgWidth":1920,"imgHeight":1080,"mobileImgWidth":1080,"mobileImgHeight":1080,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":[]},"images":[],"description":"Today, Ford Performance becomes Ford Racing.

Meanwhile, some fast-growing newer industries — think AI companies and EV battery plants — are also actively seeking electricians, welders, HVAC installers, and other skilled workers, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting that demand will continue to grow.</p>","<p>To understand how the Essential Economy reached this point — and what’s needed to address it — we spoke with Rachel Lipson, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-founder of the Harvard Project on Workforce. Lipson, whose research focuses on emerging jobs that don’t require four-year college degrees, will moderate “A New Workforce Blueprint: Scaling Skills, Driving Productivity” at the <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/ford-pro-accelerate\" rel=\"nofollow\">upcoming Ford Pro Accelerate Conference</a> in Detroit, where she will outline the case for a new workforce model. She’s also written an <a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lipson-Missing-Productivity-Strategy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aspen Institute research paper</a> describing an innovative R&amp;D-inspired approach to workforce development.</p>","<p>Here, she discusses the Essential Economy’s labor and productivity challenges and outlines what’s needed to make that new training approach a reality. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>","<h3>First, what’s the big-picture reason behind the labor shortage and the productivity decline?</h3>","<p>Lipson: It’s not that we don’t have the people out there who could do the jobs. It’s that they aren't necessarily able to connect to the jobs due to lack of awareness, lack of necessary skills and training, or the lack of connections between education and training programs and the jobs on the other side. Historically, we’ve underinvested in pathways outside the higher-education system. We had multiple decades of a cultural focus on “college for all” and a perception that trade jobs were dirty or dangerous or your grandfather’s type of job. Today, these roles are dealing with some of the most complex and high-frontier technologies in the world.</p>","<p>If the U.S. is going to have technological leadership in key industries, it's all going to rely on a foundation of having people who can build new facilities and technologies, operate and maintain them, and upgrade and modernize them over time.</p>","<p>If we don’t have people across the pipeline who can do that, none of our biggest aspirations will be possible. It’s important to connect productivity growth that unlocks prosperity for everyone in the economy to workforce training for the key roles and sectors that are critical to that growth.</p>","<h3>How does U.S. spending on vocational training compare with that of our global peers?</h3>","<p>The U.S. is second to the last in all of the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]. The only country that's behind us is Mexico. So in comparative terms, we spend very little on job training. In addition, the U.S. adoption of apprenticeships — paid opportunities to work and learn at the same time, with a clear career pathway — is way lower than almost all of our peer countries in OECD, and the public investment in those kinds of models is also far lower.</p>","<h3>Your report recommends that the United States adopt an R&amp;D-like model for workforce development. What are the benefits of that approach?</h3>","<p>At the highest level, we’d see a lot more investment like what we’ve seen in R&amp;D, where the U.S. is the global leader. But it’s not just government money that’s gone into R&amp;D. The government has served as a catalyst and, these days, the private money far exceeds the public investment.</p>","<p>So if we apply that to workforce development, if we use public funds to kickstart things, we'll see more companies coming in with their own dollars to help develop the human-capital base. We'll have more opportunities that are accessible to anyone interested, regardless of the number of degrees or credentials they have.</p>","<p>If there are clear opportunities that will lead to good-paying jobs, we'll see more participation in the labor force overall. That really matters for the U.S.’s role in the world, in the global competition with China. If we're going to keep up or win in some of these key industries, human-capital strategy absolutely has to be part of that.</p>","<h3>What’s needed to make the R&amp;D approach a reality?</h3>","<p>We're going to need some political will in terms of both dollars and focus at the federal level, state, and local levels. We're going to need the education system to modernize and adapt to where the economy is today, not what it was built for 100 years ago. We're going to need partnerships with companies that can think differently about their role in this, helping build a system where more people can get access to learning and advancement on the job. And we’re going to need innovators who can build new models, not just rely on what we've done in the past.</p>","<p>But I have a sense of optimism.

high alpine creeks. Getting there takes skill and the right vehicle, but it’s worth the journey. The water is fast, with pockets of small pools tucked behind boulders and fallen branches, but the cutthroat and brook trout are plentiful.</p>","<p>As the creek climbs past the treeline, the trees begin to open up. It’s the perfect place to disconnect and breathe. You have no worries, no distractions. You’re present.</p>","<p>When my son, Colter, was only three weeks old, I took him on his first fishing trip. It was only a day trip, but I had our Ford Bronco packed with a week’s worth of supplies. The Bronco is a part of our home and a place where he has been fed and cared for during our adventures into the wild. I strapped him onto my chest, rigged up my fly rod with a simple parachute Adams pattern, and caught a small, vibrant brook trout almost immediately.</p>","<p>I keep my fingers crossed this will be a core memory for Colter someday. I imagine that 20 or so years from now, he will say, \"Yeah, my mom has been bringing me up here since I was a month old.\" It just feels really good that we are creating these memories.</p>","<p>I was born and raised in Michigan. I spent my summers as a child running barefoot through cornfields and wading in creeks, looking for worms to fill my mother’s bait canister. We practically spent the entire summer at the end of a dock in northern Michigan, fishing for bass and walleye. I inherited my passion for fishing from my mother, who would be awake before the sun, determined to catch a big bass before anyone else even made it out of bed.</p>","<p>Growing up in Flint, I was immersed in a community shaped by hard work and resilience. My family’s roots in the automotive industry instilled in me a deep sense of pride. It’s a pride born from more than just employment; it’s a connection to a company like Ford, dedicated to craftsmanship and perseverance. It only made sense that my first car would be a 2006 Ford Ranger, followed by an Explorer, and eventually a 2025 Badlands Bronco.</p>","<p>Being in nature, out on the water where I can center my attention on the fish and connect with their behavior, grounds me. That creek gives me a place to reflect and be myself. Nature is good for the soul.</p>","<p>As a guide for more than 11 years, I love being able to connect others with the river and the fish and help them experience the sacred remoteness of the outdoors.</p>","<p>I get to share my knowledge and pull people out of their own world of work and emails and commitments. I encourage them to disconnect from their phone and be present in that same meditative space that keeps me coming back to the wild.</p>","<p>When I first moved to Colorado and went out fly fishing, there weren’t many women in the sport, but that’s changed. Now, I see more and more women embracing fishing, even deciding to become guides and inspiring others to explore their passion for the outdoors. They are saying, \"I do belong. I can go fish. I can do this, too.\"</p>","<p>For our adventures, I rely on my 2025 Bronco Badlands, which I outfit with a rod vault and rooftop tent. As a mother exploring remote sites with young Colter, a trustworthy vehicle is essential for navigating gnarly terrain and helping to ensure our safety. I need to feel confident in my vehicle, whether going to school or on an adventure.</p>","<p>The Bronco is more than just a vehicle. It’s our home base for every adventure and an essential part of our journey. It connects me to my roots and fuels our spirit of exploration. Most importantly, it ensures that my son and I can create countless memories together, inspiring him to embrace the wild and the adventures that lie ahead.</p>","<p><i>Shyanne Orvis is a Team Bronco ambassador.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/dropping-the-bass-how-im-building-wild-memories-with-my-son/how-i’m-building-wild-memories-with-my-son","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:vehicle-models/bronco","fordmediasite:vehicle-types/off-road","fordmediasite:vehicle-models"]},{"title":"Grandpa Gifted Me the Outdoors.

Whenever I caught one, he would be so happy. The next day, we would go to church, and he would tell everybody, \"You won't believe what Darryl caught!\"</p>","<p>Later, my grandpa got me into hunting, too. He taught me how to shoot, respect the land, and, most importantly, enjoy every moment outdoors.</p>","<p>Today, I am so blessed to live this life full time.</p>","<p>I am out there every day, hunting, fishing, and filming as part of 24.7Hunt. I want to show people — especially kids and folks who do not always see themselves in this world — that you can look any kind of way. You can hunt however you want. You can listen to whatever music. Because the outdoors is for everybody.</p>","<p>Ford has been with me every step of the journey. My 2024 F-150 Lariat is not just a truck to me. It gets me where I need to go and powers the whole experience. Literally.</p>","<p>Last year, I took on one of my wildest trips yet, chasing elk out West with a cameraman. From my house in Camden, Arkansas, to McCall, Idaho, it is 28 hours, pulling a trailer the whole way. Instead of staying in a hotel or lodge, I slept in the trailer. I plugged the trailer into my F-150 Lariat truck’s ProPower Onboard to get heat and air conditioning. That is how we got through the nights and the bad thunderstorms. I even hooked it up to Starlink to FaceTime my wife and kids back home.</p>","<p>We were 25 or 30 miles off paved roads, so having a reliable, four-wheel-drive truck that could go off-road, around bends, and up mountains was most important. You have to be able to trust your truck, because being that far from home, you do not have time for failures.</p>","<p>I was gone for 17 days, and my Ford F-150 is a big part of the reason I could stay out there for so long. But after all that time, I still did not get an elk.</p>","<p>So after coming home for a day, I went to Colorado with some buddies for another week and finally was successful. I brought a 298-inch bull to the ground. It was a surreal moment — one of those things I wanted to do since my grandpa bought me my first gun. I ended up traveling 5,500 miles of road, plus walking 62 miles up and down mountains, to get it done. It was emotional.</p>","<p>The F-150 plays a big role in our family life, too. The kids are 1, 2, and 3 years old, and it fits all three car seats. The five of us took an 8-hour road trip to the beach for a recent vacation, and everybody was comfortable the whole time. The kids were able to watch movies, listen to music, and look up through the twin panel at nighttime. They love watching the stars.</p>","<p>My two oldest sons love to say, \"Daddy, can we go fishing today?\" So we go down to the pond two or three times a week.

SuperVan 4.2 wasn't far behind at 6:48.2, grabbing seventh place all-time.</p>","<p>Two incredible achievements in one day. One clear purpose: we build the future by testing it at the limit.</p>","<h3>What Happens on Track Stays in Your Truck</h3>","<p>The Nürburgring is brutal. It’s called the “Green Hell” for a reason. With 13 miles and 73 corners, it'll break anything that's not bulletproof. When our systems survive this punishment, they're ready for whatever you throw at them.</p>","<p>Here's the thing: every breakthrough from these record runs goes straight into the trucks you'll actually drive. Those aerodynamics lessons we learned running through corners? They make your F-150 Lightning more efficient on the highway. The systems that kept our batteries happy during six minutes of hell? They'll keep working when you're stuck in summer traffic.</p>","<p>What we prove at insane speeds becomes what you can count on at any speed.</p>","<h3>Why We Do This</h3>","<p>We could just build EVs in a lab and call it good. But that's never been how Ford works.</p>","<p>While other companies are still figuring out their electric strategy, we're out here proving ours works. These crazy fast laps teach us things you can't learn anywhere else. Our engineers get to work with real data from real extremes.</p>","<p>Right now we're prepping our next-generation affordable electric platform, and programs like this give us total confidence in what we're building. When you know your tech can handle six minutes of Nürburgring abuse, you know it'll handle anything real life dishes out.</p>","<h3>This Is How Ford Does Things</h3>","<p>We've been doing this forever — Daytona, Le Mans, now the 'Ring. The track teaches you things a conference room never could. Every breakthrough we've made, from the flathead V8 to EcoBoost to these electric beasts, started with someone saying, \"Let's see what this thing can really do.\"</p>","<p>Our EV Demonstrator Program extends that legacy into the electric era. We control our platforms, our proving grounds, our technology pipelines. This creates tighter feedback loops, greater flexibility, and total alignment with Ford's EV business strategy.</p>","<p>These aren't just cool concept cars. They're based on the trucks and vans you love that actually do the work. SuperTruck and SuperVan represent technologies that will end up in vehicles carrying your business, your crew, your family. We lead in trucks and commercial vehicles for a reason, and we plan to keep it that way in the electric era.</p>","<h3>What 6:43.482 Really Means</h3>","<p>That time represents something bigger than speed. It's proof that when we go electric, we're bringing everything Ford stands for with us — the toughness, the capability, the reliability you've counted on for decades.</p>","<p>Every minute we spend on that track is an investment in making your next Ford better. This is what happens when Ford's spirit meets tomorrow's tech.</p>","<p>We've always led by doing, not by talking. That's not changing now.</p>","<p><i>Mark Rushbrook is global director of Ford Performance.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/from-the-nürburgring-what-comes-next-starts-here/from-the-nürburgring--what-comes-next-starts-here","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:motorsports/ev-demonstrators/f-150-lightning-supertruck","fordmediasite:motorsports/ev-demonstrators","fordmediasite:motorsports","fordmediasite:vehicle-types/electric-vehicles","fordmediasite:vehicle-models/f-150-lightning","fordmediasite:vehicle-models"]},{"title":"Jim Farley’s Off-Road Trip: Day 3 on the Moab Trails","featuredImage":{"altText":"Jim Farley gifts Don Mose a Ford Motor Co.

At Snow Flats Lookout, I met with off-road enthusiasts Mandy Walden, Melissa Clark and Brian Clark. They’ve been racing and building a community here for years.

But our main goal remains the same: today, at John Grappone Ford in Bow, New Hampshire, we are helping electric vehicle customers enjoy the freedom of the open road with six DC fast chargers at our dealership.</p>","<p>We are proud to be part of <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/electric/public-ev-charging-near-me/#ford-charge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Charge</a>; a new network officially launching today, and backed by Ford with nearly 1,200 Ford-branded fast chargers located at more than 320 Ford dealerships. Ford Charge offers reliable, public charging for all compatible electric vehicles and we’re proud to be the first Ford dealer in the country to have chargers go live on the Ford Charge Network.</p>","<p>Ford Charge has immense potential because it offers drivers the peace of mind of being backed by Ford and is open to any compatible electric vehicle, regardless of make and model.</p>","<p><b>From Humble Beginnings to Leaders in Electric Vehicles</b></p>","<p>Our family business began with a single gas station. My great-grandmother and two of her daughters worked at a local factory making Model T parts to help supplement the pay her husband was bringing home as a stone cutter. When they saved enough and made a handshake deal with a local bank for a loan, it was time to open their doors to neighbors and tourists who passed their station on New Hampshire’s main north-south throughway.</p>","<p>They took care of their community in more ways than one, providing not only support for local motorists, but a helping hand to neighbors in need. That commitment has passed down through four generations of my family. Knowing that we can help electric vehicle drivers get where they’re going connects me back to my great-grandparents and their first business venture.</p>","<p>Our chargers are often among the busiest in the area, and they are the most used across the whole Ford Charge network. I am proud of our team at Grappone Ford who made this a reality.</p>","<p>Ford Charge is part of the BlueOval Charge Network, North America’s largest integrated network, which unites thousands of chargers, and gives Ford electric vehicle drivers access to fast chargers within 18 miles on most U.S. highways.</p>","<p>Customers can easily find Ford Charge stations through the BlueOval Charge Network for Ford customers, PlugShare, or the Shell app. These apps show charger locations, real-time availability, and pricing, making it simple for drivers to plan their routes and charging stops. While most locations are 24/7, charger availability for each specific location is clearly visible through the FordPass app, PlugShare, and the Shell app.</p>","<p>Beyond easy access, Ford Charge also prioritizes customer support. Ford Charge offers 24/7 live agent call center support, available to any user of a Ford Charge station. If a customer has an issue or a question during their charging session, they can call a dedicated support line for immediate help, any time of day or night.</p>","<p><b>Praise from Electric Vehicle Drivers</b></p>","<p>We know these chargers are a benefit to electric vehicle drivers in the area. We are proud to be part of the launch of Ford Charge, and helping drivers get to where they need to go, as we’ve been doing for over 100 years and plan to do so for the next 100 years. At our store, we’ve received some very positive feedback:</p>","<p>“Kudos to your location for putting in high speed charging stations!

They’re pressed into steel, fired in engine blocks, and live in the space between a driver’s hands on a steering wheel. They are the stories of who we wanted to be, on a Saturday night with a full tank of gas, radio up and windows down.</p>","<p>For sixty years, the Ford Mustang has held one of those stories. It was never just a car. It was a promise, a vibe. In 1964, it offered the rest of us a glimpse of freedom, a taste of the performance that was usually locked away in expensive European garages. It was a machine built for the working man’s dream, a primal shout made of metal, rubber, and pure aspiration.</p>","<p>We’ve come to believe that an object that holds so many of our stories — our first dates, our graduations, our own private rebellions — deserves to be explored in a new way. It has earned the right to be experienced, in the same way we line up to stand inside Van Gogh’s brushstrokes or to witness the silent gold of a boy king’s tomb.</p>","<p>That is why we are bringing its story to life. This November, in downtown Los Angeles, we are opening American Icon: A Mustang Immersive Experience – built by the same minds that resurrected the worlds of Jurassic Park and the Titanic.</p>","<p>This is not a museum. You don’t look at this story from behind a velvet rope.</p>","<p>This is where you step inside of it. You won’t just see the blueprints; you’ll feel the nervous energy of the Dearborn design studio in 1963, a place humming with the hope of getting it right. You won’t just hear the sound of a V8; you’ll feel the rumble in your bones, the same vibration that has telegraphed freedom to generations. You will walk through the cultural moments that the Mustang didn’t just influence, but helped create.</p>","<p>Because the Mustang’s story was never truly ours to write. It was written by all of you, on the screen and in the streets. It became a character. That blur of Highland Green carving up the hills of San Francisco wasn’t just a prop; it was McQueen’s coiled, silent co-star. That impossibly white convertible in Goldfinger wasn’t just product placement; it was a signal to the world that something new and uniquely American had arrived.</p>","<p>That story is still being written, in the silent, immediate torque of the Mach-E and the raw, visceral howl of the seventh generation. The soul of the thing — that restless need to push forward — remains unbroken.</p>","<p>This is our invitation to you. Whether you had a poster of one on your wall, or your dad had one in the driveway, or you’ve just always wondered what all the fuss was about, we want you to come and feel it for yourself.</p>","<p>Come feel what we’ve felt for sixty years.</p>","<p>We’ll see you in Los Angeles.</p>","<p><i>Mark Truby is chief communications officer at Ford Motor Company.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/mustang-immersive/more-than-a-machine","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:vehicle-models","fordmediasite:vehicle-models/mustang"]},{"title":"A Bangkok Café Nourishes Futures at the Ford Community Center Thailand ","featuredImage":{"altText":"Na Café provides hands-on training for youth aged 17 to 25, many of whom have had experiences with detention centers, substance use, or other hardships.","altTextMobile":null,"tags":"community","tagsMobile":null,"description":"Na Café provides hands-on training for youth aged 17 to 25, many of whom have had experiences with detention centers, substance use, or other hardships.","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"Na Café","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":null,"mobileContributor":null,"mobileCreator":null,"mobileRights":null,"mobileTitle":null,"mobileUsageTerms":null,"mobileOwner":null,"imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg","imgUrlMobile":null,"alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":null,"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":null,"defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":null,"defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":null,"defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":null,"defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand/Event_6.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":null,"imgWidth":5472,"imgHeight":3648,"mobileImgWidth":0,"mobileImgHeight":0,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":null},"images":[],"description":"Tucked into a century-old house at the Ford Community Center in Bangkok, Na Café is part of a broader mission to support young people in Thailand.","tag":"Community","tags":[{"title":"Community","name":"fordmediasite:community"}],"cta":{"href":"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/bangkoks-na-cafe-nourishes-futures-at-ford-community-center-thailand","optionalClassName":null,"ariaLabel":"A Bangkok Café Nourishes Futures at the Ford Community Center Thailand","label":"A Bangkok Café Nourishes Futures at the Ford Community Center Thailand","target":"_self","icon":null,"csr":true},"date":1756306800000,"publishedDate":"2025-08-27","modifiedDate":"2025-08-27 00:01:57-0400","author":{"fullName":"RoNeisha Mullen","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/RoNeisha Mullen.jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>At first glance, Na Café looks like any other café. Tucked into a century-old house at the Ford Community Center in Bangkok, it serves great coffee, hosts lively community dinners, and has a backyard with trees, a rare thing in the city.</p>","<p>But behind the scenes, it’s something much more. It’s a space where youth and refugee families come to train, heal, and build something new.</p>","<p>Founded by Sakson “Saks” Rouypirom, Na Café is part of a broader mission to support young people in Thailand who have been impacted by trauma, addiction, or poverty.</p>","<p>“We start with our youth and build around that,” he said. “This isn’t just about food, it’s about giving people a platform.”</p>","<p>In August, Mary Culler, president of Ford Philanthropy, joined Sati Foundation for dinner at NaCafé in Thailand. The space was originally offered through a partnership with the Ford Community Center, which continues to support its growth.</p>","<h3>A Place to Learn, Heal, and Grow</h3>","<p>Na Café provides hands-on training for youth aged 17 to 25, many of whom have had experiences with detention centers, substance use, or other hardships. They learn food prep, sanitation, and hospitality, and work alongside a small team that includes a social worker, a psychologist, and peer mentors.</p>","<p>Youth also have access to therapy, music sessions, and after-school programs like DJing and skateboarding.</p>","<p>“You can’t just teach job skills and expect change,”Rouypirom said. “A lot of these youth are dealing with things that require care first, then structure.\"</p>","<p>More than 100 youth have completed the program. Some move on to work in hotels or restaurants, while others stay involved, mentoring new participants or supporting other community programs.</p>","<p>As Ford Building Together expands worldwide, Na Café reflects the spirit in action, demonstrating how local programs can drive meaningful change through community development and education.</p>","<p>Rouypirom's path to this work began far from Bangkok. Born in New Jersey and raised in New York, he spent his teenage years volunteering in a pediatric HIV ward. He played music with the kids and watched how they quietly managed pain and routine treatments. That experience, along with the values instilled by his Thai parents, shaped his desire to help others.</p>","<p>He originally studied to become a doctor, but eventually realized he wanted to work on a different kind of healing through safe spaces, mental health support, and opportunity. That shift led to the creation of the SATI Foundation and, later, community-focused projects like Na Café.</p>","<h3>Food That Tells a Story</h3>","<p>One of the café’s most meaningful efforts is the Urban Refugee Kitchen. Each month, families from countries like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Sri Lanka host community dinners, preparing dishes from their cultures and sharing stories with guests. Before each event, the families go through a two-month training that covers food safety, menu planning, and hospitality basics.</p>","<p>“We had an Afghan mother and her two daughters,”Rouypirom said. “She had never been allowed to work before. After joining the program, they ran their own dinner, and now the daughters are in school on scholarship.”</p>","<p>These dinners often sell out. They draw locals, Ford employees, international students, and diplomats. While the food is a big part of the appeal, it’s the conversations and personal connections that make them memorable.</p>","<h3>Strength in Stories</h3>","<p>Na Café isn’t a polished café. Some customers are surprised when youth trainees work at a slower pace or wear mismatched uniforms.Rouypirom sees that as part of the point. “It’s a place where people are growing,” he said.</p>","<p>Support from Ford, UN agencies, and local NGOs helps keep the café going. But for Rouypirom, success is not measured in numbers. “I’ve worked with some of these kids for ten years,” he said. “They’re working, raising families. They just needed a place to start.”</p>","<p>He hopes to take the concept beyond Bangkok, hosting pop-ups in cities like Detroit, bringing together refugee families who have resettled in the United States and Canada. “I want to show the strength in these stories,” he said. “Not just the struggle.”</p>","<p>And for anyone who walks into Na Café, he hopes they leave with more than just a good meal. “If you walk away with a little more empathy or a new way of seeing someone, that’s impact, too.”</p>","<p><i>RoNeisha Mullen is communications manager at Ford Philanthropy.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand-/a-bangkok-café-nourishes-futures-at-the-ford-community-center-thailand","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:community"]},{"title":"Jim Farley’s Off-Road Trip: Meeting Bronco Lovers in Moab on Day 2","featuredImage":{"altText":"Jim Farley's Off-Road Bronco Trip: Day 2 Diary from Moab, Utah","altTextMobile":null,"tags":"off-road,jim-farley-from-the-road,bronco,vehicle-models","tagsMobile":null,"description":"Jim Farley's Off-Road Bronco Trip: Day 2 Diary from Moab, Utah","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"Jim Farley's Off-Road Bronco Trip: Day 2 Diary from Moab, Utah","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":null,"mobileContributor":null,"mobileCreator":null,"mobileRights":null,"mobileTitle":null,"mobileUsageTerms":null,"mobileOwner":null,"imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg","imgUrlMobile":null,"alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":null,"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":null,"defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":null,"defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":null,"defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":null,"defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/jim-farley-off-road-bronco-trip-day-2-diary-from-moab-utah/farley-off-road-bronco-day-2-diary-01.jpeg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":null,"imgWidth":2999,"imgHeight":2251,"mobileImgWidth":0,"mobileImgHeight":0,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":null},"images":[],"description":"Ford President and CEO Jim Farley is hitting the open road.

Full-time, Darin is a fabricator at our Ford Arizona Proving Grounds and also supports the Bronco Off-Road Racing team as a chase vehicle. He lives and breathes this stuff! He even built his own Bronco support trailer from the ground up and can fix just about anything. On the road, that’s the kind of teammate you want when tackling the toughest challenges. Darin knows exactly what it takes to keep a Bronco adventure going!.</p>","<p><b>4:00 PM </b>- Another person I am learning from this week is Caziah Franklin. He’s a great Ford Bronco Ambassador and helps make the outdoors more approachable for people that didn’t grow up in this space. He’s encouraging others to explore off-roading and camping. It was fun meeting him on the trail and seeing how he’s outfitted his Bronco.</p>","<p><b>4:30PM</b> - My daughter Lilly and I stopped at the North Butler Wash Ruins, a breathtaking place filled with history and beauty.

hands-free highway driving trends we saw in 2024 across the U.S. from Ford and Lincoln owners.</p>","<p>BlueCruise<sup>1</sup> shines on the highway in stop-and-go traffic for commutes and on long trips, and the data shows it’s used for both. In 2024, more than 70% of BlueCruise trips taken in the U.S. were under 20-minutes, such as a daily commute. However, its value was also proven on longer excursions like road trips as customers used BlueCruise nearly 50% of the time when driving longer than one hour.</p>","<p>What else did we uncover for 2024? Let’s jam out to the data trends.</p>","<p>Full disclosure: This data is anonymized and is only collected from customers who have opted in to share it with Ford.</p>","<h3>The Most Wonderful Time(s) of the Year for BlueCruise</h3>","<p>Labor Day weekend is right around the corner and it is one of the most popular times to use BlueCruise. In 2024, the Friday heading into Labor Day weekend – August 30, 2024 – had the highest number of BlueCruise trips taken out of the entire 2024 calendar year: Nearly 44,000 trips were taken, up about 32% from 2023. It’s been the day with the most trips taken for the last two years in a row.</p>","<p>With Labor Day marking the unofficial end of summer, many people are wrapping up their work week that Friday and then hitting the road to enjoy the long weekend. In fact, in 2024, <a href=\"https://newsroom.aaa.com/2024/08/top-labor-day-travel-trends-of-2024/\" rel=\"nofollow\">INRIX shared</a> that the afternoon and early evening hours of Thursday and Friday heading into the Labor Day Weekend would be the most congested for those traveling by car, so it seems natural that many would want to take advantage of BlueCruise during these heavily trafficked times.</p>","<p>In comparison, the Saturday ahead of the holiday travel season – December 21, 2024 – was the day where customers logged the most distance (610,000 miles) and spent the most time (8,600 hours) using BlueCruise, as folks headed out to enjoy time with family and friends.  The data tells us that people are travelling further distances to one destination during the holiday season and perhaps staying put for longer vs. taking multiple trips on a single day to get where they need to go.</p>","<h3>F-150 Truck Customers Take the BlueCruise Usage Crown</h3>","<p>For 48 years, the F-series has been America’s best-selling truck.<sup>2</sup> Now, we’re seeing F-150 take the crown for the most miles driven and time spent using BlueCruise. In 2024, F-150s logged 58 million miles and 826,000 hours with BlueCruise activated, up 42% from 2023. F-150 truck owners also took nearly the same number of trips as Mustang Mach-E owners.</p>","<p>Additionally, we can’t gloss over the all-electric F-150 Lightning truck. We saw a dramatic increase in usage year-over-year, with miles and hours driven up 59% and trips taken up 54%.</p>","<p>Overall, BlueCruise is being used by customers whether they have gasoline, hybrid or all electric engines – and across very different vehicle types such as SUVs and trucks.  </p>","<h3>Highway Battle for the Most BlueCruise Trips</h3>","<p>Ford and Lincoln took lots of BlueCruise trips across U.S. highways in 2024. But which highway took the lead?</p>","<p>Michigan I-96 had the most trips taken with nearly 60,000 trips in 2024 – rightly so as it’s in Ford’s backyard. If you take proximity to Ford off the table, Florida I-95 had the most BlueCruise trips taken, which connects the beautiful East coast of Florida and runs through Miami, West Palm Beach, Daytona Beach, St. Augustine and Jacksonville. (Check out our <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/content/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/2025-bluecruise-road-trips.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miami to St. Augustine BlueCruise summer road trip route</a>!)</p>","<h3>The Final Countdown to 2025</h3>","<p>In 2024, 140 million miles were logged, and 2 million hours were spent using BlueCruise by Ford and Lincoln owners – up 33% over the previous year. Additionally, the number of trips taken was up 24% from the previous year with nearly 12 million trips taken.</p>","<p>Now, we’re over halfway through 2025 and we’ve expanded the number of vehicles where BlueCruise can be activated across our line-up, including the 2025 Explorer SUV. We also expanded availability to nearly 90% of 2025 Expedition SUV models, which are rolling out to customers now.</p>","<p>With over 1 million BlueCruise-equipped vehicles on the road today and more flexible <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2024/ford-lowers-bluecruise-annual--monthly-plan-pricing\" rel=\"nofollow\">ways to activate</a>, we expect even more customers to enjoy an easier commute or road trip with their families.

However, this sector faces a critical challenge: significant labor shortages and declining productivity. This threatens our economic resilience and growth.</p>","<p>Building on the conversation he started with Walter Isaacson at the <a href=\"https://www.aspenideas.org/sessions/fords-ceo-on-the-essential-economy-and-its-untapped-potential\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aspen Ideas Festival</a>, Ford President and CEO Jim Farley is convening a group of leaders to discuss productivity solutions at Ford Pro Accelerate in Detroit on September 30 at the newly restored Michigan Central Station.</p>","<p>\"We will need to summon all the best ideas and to convene the disrupters and innovators – and set them to work on solving problems too often overlooked but that persist right under our noses,” said Jim Farley. “Doing so isn’t just a smart investment for America’s future, it’s absolutely essential.\"</p>","<p><a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/accelerating-productivity-growth-in-the-united-states/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aspen Economic Strategy Group research</a> underscores the urgency:</p>","<ul>\n <li>A Deepening Productivity Divide: From 2015 to 2024, productivity in the information sector grew by 5.3 percent annually. In contrast, essential industries saw different results, with construction productivity averaging -0.1 percent, manufacturing -0.7 percent, and transportation -1.8 percent.<br><br></li>\n <li>A Pathway to Greater Prosperity: If productivity in the Essential Economy had kept pace with its growth over 20 years prior, US GDP would be estimated 10 percent higher today.<br><br></li>\n <li>A Growing Workforce Gap: Many of our nation's most foundational industries are being hampered by a generational decline in available skilled labor, creating downstream challenges for everyone.<br><br></li>\n <li>Productivity Lost to Process: This decline is not just about technology, but also policy. Complex regulations mean it can take a decade or more to build a new energy transmission line, while skyrocketing costs hamper our ability to build critical infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>","<p>“The Aspen Institute is proud to partner with Ford on Accelerate. This important series of conversations on the Essential Economy will convene leaders from business, government, and civil society, responding to the call to action issued by Jim Farley at the Aspen Ideas Festival this summer,” said Dan Porterfield, president and CEO of the Aspen Institute. “Through our programming, we share Ford’s commitment to bringing people together across generations, geographies, and viewpoints to explore what it takes to build an economy that embraces innovation and where essential industries can thrive.”</p>","<p>A common thread among many of these industries is their dependence on vehicles to do the critical jobs we all rely on. With over 40% share across all fleet – size segments in the U.S., Ford owns work – and Ford Pro customers are the beating heart of the Essential Economy. Ford Pro’s mission is to accelerate their productivity with an integrated platform of vehicles, software, and services, helping them navigate the diverse and demanding challenges they face today.</p>","<p>The working session will bring a powerful coalition of leaders from the heart of these essential industries to identify solutions to shared productivity barriers.</p>","<p><a

The freedom,the adventure, the endless possibilities – with good music... snacks... and, most important – a great navigator. When I started my career as a product planner, I spent months on the road researching what customers want in their vehicles. How? I watched how they drove and used their vehicles, and I talked to them. Today, many years later, I still love to get out and learn from customers.</p>","<p>For the third year in a row, I’m hitting the road – this time in a <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/suvs/bronco/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bronco Badlands</a> Sasquatch.

This year, I’m taking this Bronco off-road for a three-day trip through some of the most remote and iconic trails and landscapes of the American West.</p>","<p>This year, I’ll be with trail guides, enthusiasts, wilderness rescue teams, and conservation volunteers to experience how our customers are using their off-road capable vehicles day to day. My goal is to have most of the miles driven on unpaved roads and trails – taking full advantage of Bronco’s ingenious tech to go where few other vehicles can. And along the way, I’ll get to spend time with some awesome people.</p>","<p>I hope to learn a lot – not just about how our customers are using Broncos today, but also what opportunities we have to keep making Bronco better and more useful in the future.

Just the other week, one stood out: watching our Ford Puma Gen-E literally reach new heights. It was a sight to behold.</p>","<p><br>\n The initial spark of an idea was to have our electric Puma majestically overlook Rouen, perched on the rooftop terrace of a Le Rouef restaurant. Getting it up there, though? That was the real challenge. This wasn't just about a cool photo op; it was about showcasing the Puma Gen-E's innovative spirit in a truly unforgettable way.</p>","<p><br>\n We teamed up with some incredibly skilled crane operators. Before the big day, we spent a lot of time figuring out the Puma's suspension and the perfect lifting axis. When the moment finally arrived, the initial lift went off without a hitch, which definitely helped calm my nerves. The really nervous bit came near the top, trying to thread the vehicle through that narrow gap between the building's roof and the hand railing. With the crane almost fully extended, it looked quite perilous to me, but the team seemed confident.</p>","<p>In the end, we had to significantly shorten the ropes holding the Puma to allow both the crane arm and the car to squeeze through. When those Puma Gen-E tyres finally touched down on the rooftop, I think you could hear a collective sigh of relief all the way across Rouen!</p>","<p>Once it was up there, especially during the French press tests we hosted, we seized the opportunity to show off the GigaBox and the Puma Gen-E's impressive boot capacity. It was genuinely fun to watch journalists and content creators play a kind of puzzle game with all sorts of accessories, demonstrating just how much the Puma Gen-E can swallow. It brought home the sheer practicality of this car in such a clear, tangible way – something I'm always eager to highlight when we talk about our vehicles. It's not just about the electric drive; it's about how seamlessly the Ford Puma Gen-E fits into your everyday life.</p>","<p>Naturally, we wanted to capture every single moment, so we made sure to do a full drone shoot of this incredible ascent. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed making it happen – seeing our vision literally elevated certainly gave me a huge sense of satisfaction.<br></p>","<p>This isn’t the first time Ford vehicles have found themselves in high places either.</p>","<p><i>Celine Armitage is the chief press officer for our Ford of France communications team</i></p>","<p></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/puma-gen-e-scales-new-heights/puma-gen-e-scales-new-heights","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:business-unit/heritage-vault"]},{"title":"Are Workplace Policies Ready to Issue Electric Vehicles and Chargers to Employees?

Farrow","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/Britta Farrow.jpg"},"paragraphs":["<p>Is your company ready for EVs? According to The Futurum Group’s “2025 Fleet Electrification Index,” which surveyed 165 large enterprises in the U.S. with revenues exceeding $100 million, organizations remain committed and continue to advance their electric vehicle adoption plans.<sup>1</sup></p>","<p>If you’re driving a company vehicle — or expect to soon — you are likely part of this shift. In fact, 61% of organizations surveyed by The Futurum Group that currently have no electric vehicles are actively preparing to integrate them into their operations.</p>","<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Energy <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1190-june-14-2021-battery-electric-vehicles-have-lower-scheduled\" rel=\"nofollow\">underscores</a> the compelling benefits of fleet electrification. Unlike internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric fleets eliminate fuel expenses and simplify maintenance. With no oil changes or complex transmissions to service, electric vehicles have the potential to reduce both downtime and operating costs over the long term.</p>","<p>For example, Ecolab — a global sustainability leader offering water, hygiene, and infection prevention solutions — last year selected Ford Pro to accelerate the electrification of their sales and service fleet by adding over 500 Ford F-150® Lightning® Pro trucks and Mustang® Mach-E® SUVs to their fleet. Fleet electrification plays a key role in Ecolab’s plans to achieve its climate and sustainability objectives, while improving operational costs, estimated to potentially save about $1,400 in annual fuel costs on every model year 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro truck in its fleet.<sup>2</sup></p>","<p>Realizing these significant benefits and ensuring a smooth transition, however, is tied to more than just acquiring electric vehicles. Many companies understand that investing in comprehensive charging solutions is key for maximizing the full benefits of electrification. They’re proactively paving the way by leveraging practical solutions for installation, monitoring, and cost management, positioning themselves ahead of the curve in this evolving landscape.</p>","<h3>Embracing Home Charging for Work</h3>","<p>The research highlights how important home charging is for consumers in driving electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. Currently, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/confessions-from-lifelong-petrol-head-i-love-electric-jim-farley-fc81e/\" rel=\"nofollow\">80% of electric vehicle owners charge at home</a>, and nearly <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2024/ford-power-promise-gives-electric-vehicle-customers-new-confiden\" rel=\"nofollow\">90% of potential buyers</a> said charging at home would increase their likelihood of purchasing an electric vehicle.<sup>3</sup> In the commercial space, for employees using company vehicles, the ability to charge at home often becomes an anticipated and welcomed aspect of their work vehicle experience.</p>","<p>When Ecolab initially deployed their Ford F-150® Lightning® Pro trucks and Mustang® Mach-E® SUVs in their sales and service fleet, they focused on transitioning their sales and service vehicles in California to electric. With this transition, they developed relevant policies and training for associates, which included information on the expectations of the use of home chargers. With more than 400 level 2 AC <a href=\"https://www.fordpro.com/en-us/charging/custom-infrastructure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Pro chargers</a> installed in the homes of their fleet drivers already, they’ve seen benefits across the board. This success provided the confidence to expand their commitment, now aiming to add up to 500 new home chargers across 37 states by the end of 2025.</p>","<p>\"The importance of home charging for electric vehicles cannot be overstated — it allows for both cost savings and operational efficiency,” said Mike Hauge, senior manager of fleet operations at Ecolab. “By proactively establishing clear policies and management systems before vehicle delivery, we helped associates understand and realize the benefits of EVs and home charging. This empowered them to take ownership of their charging habits, maximizing their time with customers and helping contribute to Ecolab’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.”</p>","<p>In California, many Ecolab sales and service technicians start each day by unplugging their fully charged electric vehicles at home before setting out to make customer visits.</p>","<h3>Company-Issued Device Policies Lag for Electric Vehicles and Chargers</h3>","<p>While most organizations have clear policies governing company-issued devices like laptops and smartphones, research from The Futurum Group found an interesting gap when it comes to electric vehicles. Nearly 40% of large enterprises surveyed have no formal policies on employee use of company EVs, such as rules for taking vehicles home.<sup>1</sup></p>","<p>Even more striking, 41% lack policies governing the use of charging infrastructure at the workplace or home.<sup>1</sup> When policies do exist, they’re often incomplete, with only 5% of organizations having comprehensive, up-to-date guidelines covering key factors like rules for taking vehicles home and at-home charging use.<sup>1</sup></p>","<p>Over half of the surveyed enterprise leaders see facilitating residential charging for their employees as the simplest way to remove a major hurdle to EV adoption.<sup>1</sup></p>","<p>“We’re mindful that customers are cost conscious, and we’ve heard from them that during times of uncertainty, home chargers are a lower risk option for their fleet charging operations. Filling up at home with electricity can be a significant efficiency boost to your workday compared to stopping at a gas station during your commute or shift,” said Carly Dobbins-Bucklad, Strategy and Infrastructure senior manager at Ford Pro Charging.</p>","<p>“This model relies on the driver's personal electricity, making it essential for fleets to implement clear policies and leverage technology to accurately measure and reimburse the energy consumed for business needs.”</p>","<p>More than a third of enterprise leaders surveyed currently prevent employees from taking company EVs home to avoid perceived complexities.<sup>1</sup> Yet, in many cases, a smart home charging strategy can unlock efficiency gains. For example, recently business customers with plans to install depot chargers for their fleet vehicles at worksites were faced with delays, as much as 2 years in some cases due to required utility upgrades. Ford Pro worked with these customers to quickly pivot, using a feasibility study to identify drivers for home charger installations and placing smaller depots across the region. This flexible approach saved both time and cost, with residential installations proving significantly more affordable and faster to deploy than commercial infrastructure.¹</p>","<p>About a quarter of organizations surveyed are moving forward with home charging plans, some even covering the costs for the plug, installation, or reimbursing electricity costs for employees — a testament to growing confidence and operational necessity.<sup>1</sup></p>","<p>“If you’re working with a company that does it right, they take many of the burdens off your plate,” said Dobbins-Bucklad.</p>","<p>On-site charging at the workplace faces similar challenges. With no formal policy on use of workplace chargers, issues can arise around access, sharing, and personal use of company chargers — potentially exposing organizations to liability risks. As electric fleets grow and charging infrastructure scales, company policies that address operational realities will avoid confusion and ensure consistent, fair use.</p>","<p>The data is clear: While a majority of enterprise leaders see home charging as a necessary step, most still need to develop workplace policies for widespread adoption. Integrating EVs is more than buying vehicles — it requires upfront charging infrastructure planning, thoughtful policy development, and ongoing support.

In just ten months, over 12,000 customers have received complimentary home chargers and standard installation in driveways across all 50 states. That’s equivalent to a third of the number of Tesla Superchargers in North America.</p>","<h3>Dealership Perspective: The Value of Home Charging</h3>","<p>We're particularly encouraged by customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and West Virginia who are opting for the complimentary home charger and standard installation instead of the $500 cash alternative at significantly higher rates, underscoring the clear value of home charging in states where charging infrastructure is still growing.</p>","<p>Digging into what’s happening in Tennessee reveals why simply charging at home matters for areas with less charging options.</p>","<p>Matthew Barker, vice president of Two Rivers Ford, located 25 minutes east of Nashville, whose dealership has sold the second highest number of Ford electric vehicles in Tennessee since the inception of the Ford Power Promise, says, “Public DC fast chargers are still sparse [in this region], and Level 2 chargers at workplaces aren't common, so long commutes from suburban or rural homes make ‘topping-off at work’ unrealistic. Plugging in overnight isn’t just a nice to have, it’s a critical part of making the experience seamless in this region.”</p>","<p>In our BlueOval™ Charge Network — which is the largest integrated public charging network that gives you access to public charging networks from Electrify America, Tesla Superchargers, EVgo, and ChargePoint, among others — you are likely within 26 miles of a DC fast charger in the BlueOval Charge Network (and rarely more than 34 miles) when driving on a highway in the U.S.<sup>1</sup> But these chargers are typically only needed for longer trips once a customer has access to home charging.</p>","<p>Barker says Ford Power Promise is the ultimate deal closer because knowing that you can fill up at home helps reduce range anxiety the moment shoppers walk in. “This region is kind of easing into electric vehicle ownership, and there's a lot more sense of security and less range anxiety when people know that they can plug in and do most of their charging at home and then wake up the next morning and make the commute.”</p>","<p>He says Ford Power Promise answers the number one question: \"How will I charge?\" It also removes a $1,500-plus hurdle that might have pushed buyers back to a gas vehicle. The added benefit that customers then realize after purchase is that having a home charger could also help save them time and money.</p>","<h3>Going Electric in Lebanon, Tennessee</h3>","<p>Mike Sloan, a sales associate who's sold cars for 30 years, nine of which have been at Two Rivers Ford in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, is an electric vehicle convert and an owner of two F-150 Lightning trucks.</p>","<p>Sloan said he’s always needed a truck. When he found out Ford was bringing out an electric F-150, it was a no-brainer, “I live in Lebanon [Tennessee] and work in Mount Juliet, and I have a farm. I've got 50 acres filled with cows. I have to have a truck. I've always had a truck, and it used to cost a lot for gas driving back and forth to work. So, when Ford said, ‘Hey, I'm gonna have a truck that's all electric,' I jumped in with both feet, and it's been great.”</p>","<p>Before the Ford Power Promise charger and installation promotion, he had a charger installed in his garage.</p>","<p>“I tell customers I have a gas station at home. I wake up full, every day.”</p>","<p>For Sloan, the F-150 Lightning is as much a work tool as a truck — hauling feed, towing livestock, running fences. Reliable home charging keeps it ready.</p>","<p>“I've got to get cattle fed. I’ve got to carry cows to sale. And I've got to, you know, put fencing around the farm. So there's a lot of stuff that the vehicle helps me do, with all the onboard access for power ... where I can hook up my trailer or hook the generator up and go pump up a tire, or whatever I need. It's just convenient for me to have an electric vehicle and the ability that it offers outside of just driving.”</p>","<p>When Ford later offered a complimentary charger and installation for his second F-150 Lightning through Ford Power Promise, he gave the charging station to his son — another F-150 Lightning convert — who had it installed on his own.</p>","<p><b>Powering Electric Vehicle Adoption Across America</b></p>","<p>Eighty-five percent of electric vehicle owners typically fill up at home just as they’d charge a phone at night, according to IPSOS.<sup>2</sup>Thanks to Ford Power Promise, we know customers who take advantage of the complimentary home charger and installation<sup>3</sup> are charging at home the majority of the time — nearly 90% of the time in Hawaii, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nebraska, according to Ford internal data.</p>","<p>By putting home chargers in garages across all 50 states, the Ford Power Promise is helping customers save time and money one driveway at a time.

A salesperson mentioned the dealership would be hosting a blood drive the next day. Eric came back, rolled up his sleeve, and shared that he was donating in honor of his son, who had cancer.</p>","<p>His story is one of many that unfolded this summer when 13 Greater Michigan Ford dealerships partnered with the American Red Cross to host life-saving “Roll Up and Give” blood drives as part of <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-building-together-community-impact-initiative\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Building Together</a>, our new company initiative that combines philanthropic giving, employee passion, Ford’s expertise and dealer network to build stronger, more resilient communities. The goal was simple: bring people together through our dealer network to give back during a time when donations typically drop.</p>","<p>Shanna Phillips, executive assistant to owner Aaron Koehn, saw the impact of this collective effort firsthand. A former Red Cross employee, she helped champion the drive and was inspired by the dealer team’s outreach to potential donors. “Stories like Eric’s remind us why this matters,” Shanna said. “Nearly everyone knows someone whose life has been touched by a blood donation.”</p>","<h3><b>Driving Community Impact</b></h3>","<p>The Roll Up and Give<i> </i>campaign achieved outstanding results, with about 75% of donors giving blood for the very first time.</p>","<p>“I didn't realize how powerful we could be as dealers,” said Aaron, a board member for the Greater Michigan Ford Dealer Advertising Fund (FDAF), which helped organize the drive. “I know our roots in our community are strong and they're deep, but this impact blew me away.”</p>","<p>This campaign offered a new, hands-on way for both customers and staff to make a meaningful difference, while supporting a Ford Building Together partner.</p>","<p>“Efforts like this are what Ford Building Together is all about: coming together to help support our local communities,” said Mary Culler, president of Ford Philanthropy, who joined Ed Koehn Ford for their blood drive. “To Aaron Koehn and the Ed Koehn Ford team, all the participating Ford dealers, and our long-standing partner American Red Cross — a big thank you.”</p>","<h3><b>Ready to Roll Up Your Sleeve?</b></h3>","<p>The stories from this collaborative Ford dealer effort with the American Red Cross remind us that a single donation can change someone’s life.

Johns","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/Ethan Johns.jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>I’ve always had this bucket list item: swimming in all five of the Great Lakes in a single day.</p>","<p>I knew my F-150 Lightning® electric truck was the perfect partner for the adventure. It is quiet, smooth, and I can “fill up” at home with my Ford charger, kicking off my adventure ready to go. So, my wife, Molly, and I decided to just go for it.</p>","<p>Our 612-mile journey started at 5:15 a.m. in Fort Erie, Ontario. We took a sunrise dip in Lake Erie and hit the road. The plan was to drive across Ontario, into Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and end at Sand Dunes Beach for a final swim in Lake Michigan.</p>","<p>I’m used to shorter trips, but this was our first real long-distance haul. It’s a different kind of travel. Instead of just pushing through for hours, the drive itself becomes part of the experience. The ride in the F-150 Lightning is so smooth and quiet, making the long hours on the road relaxing.</p>","<p>For our route I used Google Maps via Android Auto, and the integration with the truck was a game-changer. It reads your real-time charge and adjusts the route, and its range estimates were almost always spot-on. I never felt like I had to change my driving style to preserve range, which really helps with any feeling of range anxiety.</p>","<p>We knew we would need to charge a few times, so we built that into our schedule. The stops were a welcome chance to stretch our legs. Our strategy was to charge just enough to comfortably make it to the next station. This approach helps to save time, which was crucial for our goal of swimming in all the lakes before sunset.</p>","<p>A quick 15-to-20-minute charge was often all we needed to stay on pace, guided by the truck’s integrated system. It was a good lesson in how to optimize charging on the go.</p>","<p>The hours flew by, and after dips in Lakes Erie, Ontario, Huron, and Superior, we crossed into Michigan for our final stop. We made it to Lake Michigan with just minutes to spare before the sun went down.</p>","<p>This trip proved to me that you can truly go anywhere in an electric vehicle. It was amazing to see the charging networks outside of major cities and know that my F-150 Lightning could handle the adventure. It’s not just a truck for commuting; it’s a vehicle that can help you check off those once-in-a-lifetime goals.</p>","<p><i>Ethan Johns is a battery program leader at Ford.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/completing-a-great-lakes-dream-with-my-electric-truck/completing-a-great-lakes-dream-with-my-electric-truck","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:vehicle-models/f-150-lightning","fordmediasite:vehicle-types/electric-vehicles","fordmediasite:vehicle-types/truck","fordmediasite:vehicle-models"]},{"title":"Making History (Again) with a Transit at the Nürburgring","featuredImage":{"altText":"Transit SuperVan 4.2 at Pikes Peak in 2023.","altTextMobile":"Transit SuperVan 4.2 at Pikes Peak in 2023.","tags":"supervan-4-2,motorsports,ev-demonstrators","tagsMobile":"supervan-4-2,motorsports,ev-demonstrators","description":"Transit SuperVan 4.2 at Pikes Peak in 2023.","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"Transit SuperVan 4.2","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":"Transit SuperVan 4.2 at Pikes Peak in 2023.","mobileContributor":"","mobileCreator":"","mobileRights":"","mobileTitle":"Transit SuperVan 4.2","mobileUsageTerms":"","mobileOwner":"","imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg","imgUrlMobile":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LC1_5729.jpg","alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LC1_5729.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LC1_5729.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp"],"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LC1_5729.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LC1_5729.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LC1_5729.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LC1_5729.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/supervan-4-2/LG1_2894.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","imgWidth":5472,"imgHeight":3648,"mobileImgWidth":4000,"mobileImgHeight":6000,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":[]},"images":[],"description":"Taking a Ford Transit to the limit around the ‘Ring has always been the dream for a few of us at Ford Performance, but it wasn’t until now that conditions were right for us to see what might be possible.","tag":"Supervan 4.2","tags":[{"title":"Supervan 4.2","name":"fordmediasite:motorsports/ev-demonstrators/supervan-4-2"},{"title":"Motorsports","name":"fordmediasite:motorsports"}],"cta":{"href":"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-transit-supervan-4-2-breaks-nurburgring-record","optionalClassName":null,"ariaLabel":"Making History (Again) with a Transit at the Nürburgring","label":"Making History (Again) with a Transit at the Nürburgring","target":"_self","icon":null,"csr":true},"date":1755529200000,"publishedDate":"2025-08-18","modifiedDate":"2025-08-18 06:05:55-0400","author":{"fullName":"Michael Norton","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/Michael Norton.jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>The Ford Transit has a legendary status at the equally legendary Nürburgring. That status can be traced back to an episode of the TV show \"Top Gear\" with then-presenter Jeremy Clarkson and the now sadly departed ‘Ring specialist Sabine Schmitz.</p>","<p>For those who have not seen it, the premise of the show was to try and get Clarkson to drive a Jaguar S-Type around the ‘Ring in under 10 minutes. Once he achieves this feat, Schmitz makes the now infamous statement – ‘I can go faster than that in a Ford Transit’ and from there, the story evolves into one of the most compelling challenges ever.</p>","<p>I won’t spoil the ending for those that have not seen it, but ever since that day, taking a Ford Transit to the limit around the ‘Ring has always been the dream for a few of us at Ford Performance, but it wasn’t until now that we had the right Transit, the right driver and the right conditions to see what might be possible.</p>","<p>But before we delve in to the result, what was the vehicle and more importantly, why were we doing it (apart from the glory of course)!</p>","<p>Well, the vehicle is none other than the Ford Transit SuperVan 4.2 – a bespoke 2,000-horsepower electric SuperVan designed to take on and conquer some of the greatest racetracks and events in the world. SuperVan 4.2 already holds records at Bathurst and was a winner at Pikes Peak, but there was always one track on our mind – the famous Green Hell – that we wanted to challenge ourselves at.</p>","<p>But why? Well, our electric vehicle demonstrator program has become an integral part of our broader Ford Performance racing portfolio, and for good reason. It is here that we can give our super-talented engineers, designers and aerodynamicists a clean sheet of paper and tell them to dream big.</p>","<p>This is our chance to see what is possible far beyond any rule books for any race series. Here, we can explore the boundaries of what is possible, all with the aim of bringing these learnings back in to both our race programs and our road programs. And it is already bearing fruit for us. I can’t be specific just yet for competitive reasons but suffice to say that a number of our future race programs will see the benefits from vehicles like SuperVan 4.2.</p>","<p>So how did we do? Well, in the hands of the remarkable Romain Dumas, SuperVan 4.2 was able to post an incredible time of 6:48.393 which makes it the 9<sup>th</sup> fastest vehicle ever to complete a timed lap of the Nürburgring. To put that into context, it means that the Transit SuperVan 4.2 is faster than a Porsche 911 GT3RS and the Chevrolet ZR1X. Now to be fair, this is a bespoke race car with slick tyres and 2,000 horsepower but even so, that makes this one seriously quick Transit!</p>","<p>Of course, we are very proud of our remarkable SuperVan but we never rest. There is more to come, not least with the F-150 Lightning SuperTruck that was also at the Ring on the same day. For now, we will celebrate this achievement and also remember Sabine Schmitz and her part in this amazing story. She will never be forgotten.</p>","<p><i>Michael Norton is F1 and Demonstrators program manager at Ford.</i><br></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/making-history-(again)-with-a-transit-at-the-nürburgring/making-history-(again)-with-a-transit-at-the-nürburgring","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:motorsports/ev-demonstrators/supervan-4-2","fordmediasite:motorsports"]},{"title":"OG to 6G: Why We Built the One-of-a-Kind Bronco Roadster Concept","featuredImage":{"altText":"As we celebrate six decades of Bronco heritage, we chose to look back on the truest version of the Bronco design philosophy and think about what it would look like in 2025.

The answer led us back to where it all began – what we call the OG – the 1966 U13 roadster.</p>","<p>When Ford introduced the Bronco on August 11, 1965, it was marketed as \"the world's first four-wheel drive sports car.\" That wasn't just advertising hyperbole. The Bronco team’s brief was to make a Mustang for off-road, and the result captured the same element – fun comes through simplicity – that made the pony car such an overwhelming success. \"Fun through simplicity” was central to all three of the original Bronco body styles. But where the <a href=\"https://fordheritagevault.com/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/DESCRIPTION_OPAC3/FORD_DETAIL?sessionsearch&amp;exp=sisn%20204767\" rel=\"nofollow\">U14 half-cab pickup</a> and the <a href=\"https://fordheritagevault.com/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/DESCRIPTION_OPAC3/FORD_DETAIL?sessionsearch&amp;exp=sisn%20204786\" rel=\"nofollow\">U15 wagon</a> (which is most similar to the Bronco SUV we sell today) were unquestionably fun, the U13 Bronco Roadster was the closest in execution to an off-road Mustang.</p>","<p>During the development of the 2021 Bronco and Bronco Sport, we worked with a group of experts and enthusiasts who helped guide our vision. One of them, who has since become a good friend, owns a beautifully spartan 1966 Wimbledon White roadster. We’ve admired that vehicle for a long time, and it served as the design team’s inspiration, as well as a tangible link to the Bronco’s original design DNA, for this Roadster Concept.</p>","<p>Not intended for production, the Bronco Roadster Concept is a tribute to Bronco’s roots.</p>","<p>What struck me about that original roadster was its compelling simplicity. It didn't need big tires, a lift, or off-road lights to look good. It was just this pure expression of what I call \"Go Anywhere, Open Air\" – the essential cool that made Bronco special from day one.</p>","<p>As we celebrate six decades of Bronco heritage, we chose to look back on the truest version of the Bronco design philosophy and imagine what it might look like in 2025. The one-of-a-kind result celebrates the genetic markers of adventure and freedom that still exist in every sixth-generation Bronco on the roads today.</p>","<p>When you're in a vehicle like the Bronco Roadster, you're not just passing through nature – you're immersed in it. It reminds me of riding a horse, navigating a kayak through whitewater, or mountain biking over rough terrain. You feel everything as you move through the landscape. Open air isn't just a feature – it's fundamental to what Bronco means, and it connects directly to our \"Built Wild\" philosophy.</p>","<h3>Addition by Subtraction</h3>","<p>We approached this as \"turning the 6G into an OG\" – taking our current-generation Bronco and stripping it back to capture that same essence the original roadster possessed.</p>","<p>Both our Head of Design Todd Willing and Director Paul Wraith have challenged us to remember this key aspect of the OG Bronco: the compelling simplicity. How do we make just the essential cool? It's relatively easy to keep adding elements. It's much harder to create something compelling when you keep asking yourself “What can I take away?”</p>","<p>We simplified the seating, pared back the floor, and created a utilitarian rear compartment that echoes the original. And outside, we sourced machined Fifteen52 Analog wheels, updated the tailgate to a fold-down design with the “FORD” wordmark stamped into the metal, and modified the front and rear bumper to more closely resemble the original Bronco.</p>","<p>This philosophy of intentional reduction guided our approach to modernizing a classic. We had a great baseline with the sixth-generation Bronco. With this concept, we took the liberty to simplify the execution even further with a completely open roadster.</p>","<p>This exercise reinforced something we always keep in mind: the design doesn't stop when we're done – it's only just begun. We want to imagine how our customers will make their Broncos their own, because that's fundamental to the Bronco story.</p>","<p>With the Roadster Concept, we want Bronco enthusiasts to know as we move into the future, we always remember our past.</p>","<p>This concept is our reminder that we continue to hold Bronco's original off-road mission in our goals. Because sometimes, the most profound statement you can make is knowing exactly what to leave out.</p>","<p><i>Robert Gelardi is Bronco Chief

Gelardi","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/authors/author-images/Robert_Gelardi.jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>As we celebrate the Bronco's 60th anniversary, I'm excited to share a project that captures what Bronco has always represented: Build Wild capability, readiness for fun and the ability to make it all your own.</p>","<p>In Michigan, we have a place that showcases everything Bronco is built for – Silver Lake Sand Dunes.</p>","<p>The Silver Lake Sand Dunes on the shores of Lake Michigan hold a special place in my heart and in Bronco's DNA. It was the first Bronco enthusiast event I attended back in August 2017, when we were still developing the sixth generation Bronco.</p>","<p>We saw firsthand how Bronco owners modified their heritage Broncos and how these original models combined the pure joy of open-air driving combined with serious off-road capability. All of this directly influenced the sixth-generation Bronco. Removing the doors and the roof is a hallmark of the original 1966 model – it just wouldn’t be a Bronco without it. The incredible open-air experience really makes you feel like you’re that much closer to the natural world when you’re out in the wild.</p>","<p>But it goes way beyond the doors and roof. Bronco has been designed to give drivers maximum control over their vehicles. With one hour and a wrench, you can strip this truck down, which makes it easy to two-tone your vehicle. You can change your Bronco so much that you wouldn’t recognize it.</p>","<p>Much of the same also applies to Bronco Sport, the Bronco of small SUVs. The 2025 Bronco Sport, with the available Sasquatch package, is built for high performance in sand thanks to its available Rally mode. And drawing inspiration from the full-size Bronco, it’s easier for customers to personalize and make it all their own, with new modular bumpers and Bronco bolts that signal where owners can easily install custom accessories.</p>","<p>So, we wanted to celebrate west Michigan’s unique terrain and its influence on Bronco and Bronco Sport with two vehicles personalized to celebrate what made our first trip to the dunes so special, memorable and influential. The Bronco and Bronco Sport Silver Lake Dunes Project Vehicles are custom interpretations of both Bronco and Bronco Sport that capture the essence of dune cruising, and which customers could replicate via Ford Performance Parts, Ford Accessories, and a talented vinyl decal installer.</p>","<p>Our Director Paul Wraith and Head of Design Todd Willing challenged us to modernize how we break up the compositional elements of the Bronco and Bronco Sport.</p>","<p>Working with our exceptional color and materials team, Kellie Walters and Brad Fishkin, we developed custom graphics that modernize how we break up the compositional elements of the vehicle. And we paired them with Azure Gray paint that celebrates the tones of both the sky and water that make the Silver Lake Dunes and Lake Michigan so breathtaking.</p>","<p>The graphics tell a story: the beautiful dune flowing into the horizon line of Lake Michigan, rising up into that gorgeous blue sky. We wanted to create this sense of movement, almost like you're viewing the landscape through a portal on the vehicle itself. It's not your typical stripe package, this is something that creates an immediate visual impact from a distance while staying true to what makes that landscape so special.</p>","<p>Unlike some of our more fabrication-intensive Project Vehicles, the Silver Lake Dunes Project Vehicles are built primarily with readily available parts and accessories from the Ford Performance catalog including:</p>","<ul>\n <li>Yakima Paddle Board Carriers and Cross Bars<br><br></li>\n <li>Rigid Light Bars<br><br></li>\n <li>Bull Bars (stock on Bronco Sport Badlands Sasquatch)<br><br></li>\n <li>Painted Bronco Heritage wheels and BFGoodrich T/A KO3 tires on the Bronco Silver Lake Dunes Project Vehicle<br><br></li>\n <li>Painted Mustang Mach-E Rally wheels and BFGoodrich XL TRTERTA tires on the Bronco Sport Silver Lake Dunes Project Vehicle</li>\n</ul>","<p>Additionally, custom graphics and painted fenders, tow hooks, badging, and Bucking Bronco complete the package.</p>","<p>This philosophy reflects something fundamental about Bronco: the ability to be part of our community by making your Bronco truly your own. This is key to every design decision we make. We wanted to show how, starting with a stock Bronco or Bronco Sport, you can make adjustments that express your individual style and create something as unique as you are.</p>","<p>We're always watching what enthusiasts do with their vehicles – what resonates, how they push boundaries, how they adapt their Broncos for their specific adventures. These Project Vehicles, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/moab-inspired-enhanced-ford-bronco-project-vehicles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bronco Off-Roadeo™: Arches Edition and the Bronco Off-Roadeo: Cliffhanger Project Vehicle</a>, represent our way of trying new ways to inspire personalization within the Bronco community.</p>","<p>We see Bronco's modularity and customization capability as something we need to enable.</p>","<p>The Silver Lake Dunes Project Vehicles vehicles represent our commitment to doubling down on this philosophy. We want Bronco to be even more modular, more adaptable, more buildable to however someone wants to access their favorite wild. Because depending on where your favorite wild is, you're going to equip, tune, and customize differently.</p>","<p>That's been true for sixty years, and it'll be true for sixty more.</p>","<p><i>Robert Gelardi is Bronco Chief Designer.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/creating-the-bronco-and-bronco-sport-silver-lake-dunes-project-vehicles/creating-the-bronco-and-bronco-sport-silver-lake-dunes-project-vehicles","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:vehicle-types/concept","fordmediasite:vehicle-types/off-road","fordmediasite:vehicle-models/bronco","fordmediasite:vehicle-models/bronco-sport","fordmediasite:vehicle-models"]},{"title":"How Country Music Turned the Ford F-150 Into a Luxury Ride","featuredImage":{"altText":null,"altTextMobile":null,"tags":"","tagsMobile":"","description":"","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":"","mobileContributor":"","mobileCreator":"","mobileRights":"","mobileTitle":"","mobileUsageTerms":"","mobileOwner":"","imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg","imgUrlMobile":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg","alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp"],"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","imgWidth":8000,"imgHeight":4500,"mobileImgWidth":6139,"mobileImgHeight":6139,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":[]},"images":[],"description":"Once a symbol of rural grit, the presence of the best-selling pickup truck in a song may now mean something else.","tag":"F-150","tags":[{"title":"F-150","name":"fordmediasite:vehicle-models/f-150"}],"cta":{"href":"https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/how-country-music-changed-ford-f-150/","optionalClassName":null,"ariaLabel":"How Country Music Turned the Ford F-150 Into a Luxury Ride","label":"How Country Music Turned the Ford F-150 Into a Luxury Ride","target":"_blank","icon":null,"csr":false},"date":1755270000000,"publishedDate":"2025-08-15","modifiedDate":"2025-08-18 09:28:18-0400","author":{"fullName":"Texas Monthly","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/authors/author-images/texas-monthly-logo.png"},"paragraphs":["<p>Once a symbol of rural grit, the presence of the best-selling pickup truck in a song may now mean something else.</p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/how-country-music-turned-the-ford-f-150-into-a-luxury-ride/how-country-music-turned-the-ford-f-150-into-a-luxury-ride","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:vehicle-models/f-150"]},{"title":"Ford Performance to Unleash Final Wave of GT Mk IV Track Day Cars","featuredImage":{"altText":"Ford Performance is about unleash the third – and final – wave of production of the Ford GT Mk IV.

After nearly a decade of hand assembling every Ford GT of this generation in the same facility, this run will mark the end of this line of iconic road and race cars. </p>","<p>With the majority of the 67 total units produced already in the hands of customers, Ford Performance is now taking orders on the remaining cars. Created in conjunction with our GT racing partner Multimatic Motorsports, the Mk IV boasts technology that exceeds that of most GT race cars and on-track capabilities unimaginable for the street. The Ford GT Mk IV finds itself perfectly placed as a collector car that will be too thrilling to be kept in the garage.</p>","<p>It isn’t very often that we can turn the engineers at Ford and Multimatic loose and say ‘go for it!’ But that is the kind of freedom you get developing the Ford GT Mk IV. We can do things that the rules won’t permit for the race cars and things we can’t do for the road cars.</p>","<p>Our team has put everything into producing the GT Mk IV. We'll be sad to see the last one roll out of the shop, but happy knowing it’s heading to a very excited customer.</p>","<p>We developed the Mk IV from our Ford GT race cars that took first and third at the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans. The GT Mk IV represents the pinnacle of our performance capability and is a radical departure from its stablemates. It has a completely new body, powertrain, and suspension — all specifically configured to lead the pack at any track day.</p>","<p>The GT Mk IV has a third generation, EcoBoost 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V6 that is more powerful than the original race car. The 820+ horsepower being generated by the Roush-Yates Engines-built powerplant is also channeled through a more advanced clutch and paddle-shifted, six-speed gearbox than the Le Mans-winning drivers enjoyed.</p>","<p>Multimatic Adaptive Spool Valve dampers matched to the car’s more advanced suspension can be tuned by the driver from the cockpit while lapping; no need to stop for adjustments. The carbon fiber chassis is shared with the Ford GT and GT Mk II race cars but with a specialized upper roll cage unique to the GT Mk IV.</p>","<p>Generating over 2400 lbs of downforce at 150 mph, the Ford GT Mk IV can corner at over 3g. In fact, this final edition has lapped the same track quicker in the hands of non-professional drivers than the original Ford GT GTLM race car did with the factory race drivers behind the wheel. Let that sink in.</p>","<p>Due to its exclusivity and capabilities, Ford Performance and Multimatic have created an exclusive customer experience to every owner through Multimatic On Track. The private track day includes factory technical and trackside support.</p>","<p>Owners will also have a thorough shakedown of their personal GT Mk IV by development driver Scott Maxwell before having a lead-follow session to maximize their time in the car.</p>","<p>Taking it one step further, each will also have personalized one-on-one coaching from Ford Performance and Multimatic Motorsport’s professional driver roster. All of this, plus full engineering and technical support.</p>","<p>Following the day, the Ford GT Mk IV will be thoroughly inspected and readied for the owner’s next on track experience.</p>","<p>Ford and Multimatic Motorsports have begun the final run of all carbon fiber chassis for the GT Mk IV. An extremely limited number of the mid-engine machines are available and can still be built to the specific requests of buyers at this time — but experience tells us that won’t last long.</p>","<p>Inquiries about the Ford GT Mk IV are <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/performance/gt/mk-iv/?gnav=header-per\" rel=\"nofollow\">being taken until October 15</a>.</p>","<p><i>Mark Rushbrook is global director of Ford Performance.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/ford-performance-to-unleash-final-wave-of-gt-mk-iv-track-day-cars-/ford-performance-to-unleash-final-wave-of-gt-mk-iv-track-day-cars","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:motorsports"]},{"title":"Research Shows: This Lincoln Feature Can Support Relaxation","featuredImage":{"altText":"Lincoln Rejuvenate does not operate unless the vehicle is in Park, when the vehicle is off, or if any door is open.

calm — right from the driver’s seat. Stress is an increasingly common passenger in our daily lives. A recent Wakefield Research survey<sup>1</sup> commissioned by Lincoln found that 53 percent of Americans struggle to find a suitable place to unwind, making relaxation a real challenge.</p>","<p>Recognizing this, Lincoln saw an opportunity to offer more than just a transportation solution; the brand aims to transform the cabin experience and bring sanctuary moments to life for drivers. <a href=\"https://www.lincoln.com/support/vehicle/nautilus/2025/how-to-videos/video-library/lincoln-technology/6368268534112?name=lincoln-rejuvenate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lincoln Rejuvenate,</a> a multi-sensory in-vehicle experience available exclusively in the all-new 2025 Lincoln Navigator and on select trims of 2025 Nautilus, is more than just a high-tech perk.</p>","<p>Calandra Berry and Justine Nestorowich, two Lincoln Vehicle Harmony Engineers behind its development, partnered with Purdue University to see if the feature truly delivers on its promise. The project, called The Science of Rejuvenate, studied how the experience impacts stress reduction.</p>","<p>“We wanted to see the proof in the pudding,” said Nestorowich, “and to have data from an engineering research study that validates the benefits of using Lincoln Rejuvenate.”</p>","<h3>The Science of Stillness</h3>","<p>The Purdue engineering research study<sup>2</sup> titled <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2025.104592\" rel=\"nofollow\">“In-Vehicle Multi-Sensory Experiences Can Reduce Mental Stress</a>” and recently published in Applied Ergonomics, suggests that Lincoln Rejuvenate supports short-term relaxation and can measurably reduce stress while stationary in the vehicle.</p>","<p>“This work, made possible by a research and development alliance between Lincoln and Purdue, is a strong example of the real-world impact strategic industry-academic partnerships can achieve,” said Denny Yu, an associate professor in Purdue’s Edwardson School of Industrial Engineering who led this study.</p>","<p>The study involved 43 participants who first underwent a stress test before each of the following conditions:</p>","<ul>\n <li>A control group without the Rejuvenate experience</li>\n <li>A group using Rejuvenate without scent therapy</li>\n <li>A group using Rejuvenate with scent therapy</li>\n</ul>","<p>Both groups in the Rejuvenate study showed lower heart rates and brainwave patterns linked to better emotional balance and deeper relaxation. It’s the same kind of body shift you might get from meditation, listening to calming music, stretching gently, or simply sitting in a peaceful place.</p>","<p>Using brain and heart measurements (EEG and ECG), the study showed notable improvements: an average heartbeat decrease of 33 milliseconds and a 5-millisecond reduction in heart rate variability — both indicators of reduced stress and increased relaxation.</p>","<p>Lincoln’s Rejuvenate experience taps into this same relaxation response, helping the mind slow down through heart rate variability. The study also observed a small bump in the alpha/beta brainwave ratio, a marker of a calmer, clearer state of mind.</p>","<p>Participant feedback reinforced the results, with 98 percent reporting they preferred the Lincoln Rejuvenate experience over the control environment and 62 percent expressing interest in using it regularly. These findings underscore Lincoln’s commitment to credible wellness.</p>","<h3>Research Ready</h3>","<p>Berry and Nestorowich worked closely with the Purdue team to bring the study to life. Collaborating with university personnel, Nestorowich defined the study’s scope, developed protocols, moderated sessions, oversaw biometric tracking, and analyzed data.</p>","<p>Berry focused on optimizing the participant experience — crafting scripts, moderating sessions, fitting biometric devices, and sourcing scents for the Rejuvenate group. <a href=\"https://media.lincoln.com/content/lincolnmedia/lna/us/en/news/2024/02/19/scents-of-sanctuary--lincoln-introduces-its-expanded-digital-sce.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lincoln’s Digital Scent</a>, developed with expert perfumers, uses tailored in-vehicle aromas to help engage multiple senses.</p>","<p>“I also gave a sneak peek at some of the new digital scents we had been working on which are now available,” she shared. “These scents are a big part of the Rejuvenate experience, using custom fragrances in the vehicle to help you relax, refocus, or just enjoy your ride even more.”</p>","<p>Lincoln is committed to designing and engineering vehicles that elevate mood, enhance comfort, and support overall wellbeing, creating the ultimate sanctuary during stationary moments.</p>","<p><a href=\"https://media.lincoln.com/content/lincolnmedia/lna/us/en/products/crossovers---suvs/navigator/2025-lincoln-navigator.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lincoln Rejuvenate</a> offers three distinct themes, each providing a personalized pathway to calm and relaxation:</p>","<ul>\n <li><b>Aurora Borealis:</b> An ethereal visual and auditory experience inspired by the natural phenomenon.</li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n <li><b>Elements: </b>A multi-sensory journey through the fundamental elements of nature.</li>\n</ul>","<ul>\n <li><b>Waterfall Meditation</b> (in collaboration with Calm): An immersive experience evoking the serenity of cascading water.</li>\n</ul>","<p>“In today’s fast-paced world, finding time to relax is more difficult than ever,” said Sonia Rief, global vehicle director, Lincoln. “That’s what makes Lincoln Rejuvenate such a differentiating feature, it reflects on our commitment to wellness.

Deleting paint and replacing the sheet metal in the doors with bonded carbon-fiber saves about 13 pounds compared to a Mustang GTD Carbon Series with the Performance package.</p>","<p>“Mustang GTD Liquid Carbon is the ultimate expression of the Mustang GTD’s high-tech, high-performance construction and is a reminder of the race-derived, cutting-edge capability that sits beneath the surface of every Mustang GTD,” said Mustang GTD Chief Program Engineer Greg Goodall. “ Mustang GTD is a great looking car and now it stands out even more with its striking exposed carbon body and functional aero elements.”</p>","<p>As with the Carbon Series, the carbon weave of the hood, roof, rear deck, and rear wing match up perfectly down the midline of the vehicle. Additionally, fenders and side panels match up to the dorsal elements of the vehicle, presenting a cohesive pattern in the carbon-fiber bodywork. The Mustang GTD Liquid Carbon features a unique black Brembo brake caliper, matching an anodized body with gloss-black GTD script. And like the Mustang GTD Spirit of America, the Performance package is standard.</p>","<p>“High performance requires high precision. When we were designing Mustang GTD Liquid Carbon, it was essential that these small details were present, because they speak to the care and attention required to both build a vehicle like Mustang GTD and to compete and win on the world’s stage with Mustang GT3,\" said Mustang GTD Design Manager Anthony Colard.</p>","<p>The interior of the Mustang GTD Liquid Carbon stands out with a bold combination of black leather and Dinamica microfiber suede and Hyper Lime stitching on the seats, door panels, center console, instrument panel, and steering wheel. A reflective center gradient down the middle of the seats adds an additional bright spot to the purposeful and focused interior.</p>","<p>The arrival of Mustang GTD Liquid Carbon, alongside the standard model, Spirit of America, and Carbon Series, now means that Mustang GTD owners can have as much or as little exposed carbon fiber as they want.</p>","<p>The first Mustang GTD Liquid Carbon delivery is slated for October.</p>","<p><i>Joe Bellino is Mustang GTD Brand

That was me in 2023. Two long, heartbreaking years had passed since devastating floods swept through my beloved Detroit, yet so many homes still hadn’t received help. As a Detroit native, that didn’t sit right with me. I knew I needed to get my hands dirty and my boots on the ground.</p>","<p>So, I joined Team Rubicon, took a few easy steps, and before I knew it, I was a <a href=\"https://teamrubiconusa.org/how-to-get-involved/volunteer-with-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greyshirt volunteer.</a></p>","<p>One house hit me particularly hard. A family with two small children had been living with a mucky, ruined basement for over a year. As we dug in, trying to transform that mess into something livable again, I reflected on the teachings of my grandmother and mother, who would often say, “It’s a blessing to be a blessing.”</p>","<h3>A Legacy of Impact</h3>","<p>For the past two decades (yes, two decades!), I've been a proud member of the Ford Volunteer Corps. My very first volunteer project was building a home with <a href=\"https://www.habitatncc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Habitat for Humanity</a>. I remember it like it was yesterday: It was chilly, and we were doing some painting outdoors. In that moment, I felt this incredible connection to the generations of givers who came before me and Ford’s commitment to serving the community.</p>","<p>Since that first build, Ford has opened so many doors for me to give back to my community, including opportunities with all four partners for <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-building-together-community-impact-initiative\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Building Together</a>: American Red Cross, Feeding America, Habitat for Humanity, and Team Rubicon.

I’m so grateful to have these chances to volunteer and help make a difference in the lives of others.</p>","<h3>Growth Through Service</h3>","<p>Looking back on two decades of volunteering , I can honestly say it has transformed me. Every single hour given, every bead of sweat, every shared laugh with fellow volunteers makes a tangible difference. Not just for others, surprisingly, but for those of us who volunteer, too.</p>","<p>My journey began with a single project, rooted in my family's values and nurtured by Ford's long-standing commitment to community service.

This package of decorative elements, seat fabrics, and wheels takes its inspiration from the famous Fox Body Mustangs that hit the streets through the '80s and into the early ‘90s.</p>","<p>For a whole generation, these were the Mustangs they grew up loving and, even if they were too young back then, hoped to own one day.</p>","<p>“That was our hot rod that we would have liked as a kid,” said Christopher Wong, a.k.a. “Chef Wongie,” the proprietor of Curry Up Café in Los Angeles.</p>","<p>As a boy, Wong watched Mustangs driving by and was drawn to their speed, performance, and style. As an adult, he has owned at least seven Fox Body Mustangs in addition to his daily driver, a 2017 Mustang EcoBoost convertible.</p>","<p>Fox Body Mustangs were built from 1978 to 1993, spanning the era of MTV, Miami Vice, and Members Only jackets. The name “Fox” comes from a vehicle engineering platform originally intended to underlie a number of smaller rear-wheel-drive Ford and Lincoln models. It lasted the longest, by far, in the Mustang, ushering in a new era of performance with engines like the famous 5.0-liter V8.</p>","<p>“It was a reinvigoration of the brand,” said David Kinney, publisher of the Hagerty collector car price guide. “It was the reinvigoration of the word ‘Mustang.’”</p>","<p>It wasn’t just raw engine power, either, said Ted Ryan, Heritage brand manager at Ford. With improved handling, it was also the first Mustang that was easy to slide and drift.</p>","<p>Plus, in keeping with the Mustang ethos from the very beginning, this sort of performance was accessible for average Americans, not just the wealthy.</p>","<p>“The Fox Body is just like the original Mustang in spirit,” said Dave Tressler, an enthusiast from New Kensington, Pennsylvania. “Not only great cars, but they were very accessible, very affordable. Anybody who wanted one could get one, which is a part of what made the original so popular.”</p>","<p>For Ford’s designers, the job wasn’t to try to make today’s seventh-generation Mustang look like a Fox Body car, said senior designer Stefan Taylor. Instead, they wanted to create a package of interior and exterior elements that would be evocative of the era, including the teal color borrowed from a 1993 Mustang Cobra in Ford’s Heritage Vault. In the FX Package, it contrasts with white taillight covers and white intake nostrils in the grille.</p>","<p>\"When you mix that teal and the white, it captures that nostalgic feel for me,” said Adam Dokey, a Fox Body fan from Southgate, Michigan. “Honestly, it's got me really thinking about that for a next move.\"</p>","<p>Christopher Provan, a Ford enthusiast in Kent, New York, who has owned several Fox Body Mustangs, said he can definitely understand the appeal of something like the FX Package.</p>","<p>“For people who want to feel the aura of that time without the hassles of owning a 40-year-old car, this really could hit the sweet spot,” Provan said.</p>","<p>As far as Duenkel was concerned, he liked the idea of the FX Package but he’s curious to see how a new generation will embrace it.</p>","<p>“It's kind of that era, you know, the Vanilla Ice kind of thing,” he said.</p>","<p>It’s a certain feeling. As the rapper Robert Van Winkle, a.k.a. Vanilla Ice, famously said, “And I'm sweatin' like steam and you can feel the flow when I'm rollin' in my 5.0.”<br><i><br>\n   Peter Valdes-Dapena is a writer who covers automotive industry and

Field","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/Doug-20Field.JPG"},"paragraphs":["<p>A century ago, Henry Ford said he would build a car for the great multitude, one \"constructed of the best materials…after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise.\" That car, the Model T, didn’t just change Ford; it transformed society. To this day, I remain fascinated by Its elegant and simple engineering.</p>","<p>That same vision has been a constant inspiration for a new, ambitious project a small group of us has undertaken in the last three years. A project like this is the reason I came back to Ford. I couldn’t pass up the chance to help merge the restless innovation of a startup with the industrial might of a 122-year-old icon.</p>","<p>The Model T was affordable not because it was a thrifted version of other cars, but because brilliant minds took fundamentally new approaches to old problems. That’s exactly what we set out to do in creating the <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-affordable-electric-vehicle-platform-midsize-electric-truck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Universal Electric Vehicle Platform</a>.</p>","<h3>A New Way of Working</h3>","<p>We began with a single person, <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/people-at-ford/people?id=/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/other/alan-clarke\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alan Clarke</a>, previously from Tesla, and hand-picked a small team, of outside talent and Ford veterans. We weren't just looking for the best in their field, but for people with a deep desire to challenge convention. Shielded from \"well-intended corporate disruption,\" we locked the doors and kept the project secret in a small building in California. The team was a fraction of the typical size, with light oversight.</p>","<p>Every member was expected to understand how their work affected the entire vehicle and to prioritize total cost and efficiency.</p>","<p>The way the industry develops vehicles, a chassis engineer might be penalized for adding $5 to the cost of the brakes, even if that change saved $20 on the battery. We threw that thinking out.</p>","<p>Even more essential was our ability to bridge cultures and different types of teams, uniting them to work as one.</p>","<p>The integrated team had access to everything Ford offers. It also had permission to question everything, using new tools like a computer-aided design system that gave them a real-time view of their parts installed in the car.</p>","<p>Decisions were made quickly: in the building, during my bi-weekly full-day reviews, or by having our CEO Jim Farley make the final call.</p>","<h3>Physics is Not Proprietary</h3>","<p>This philosophy of deep systems integration drove us to find ways for individual parts to perform multiple functions, relentlessly stripping out complexity. This led to investment in “unicasting,” where we form massive, single aluminum parts that act as structural elements of the body and as the base parts for standalone sub assemblies.<br></p>","<p>Compared to a traditional pickup body, the team eliminated three-quarters of the parts, two-thirds of the welds, and half of the fasteners. In the electrical system, we removed over 4,000 feet of wiring—nearly a mile—compared to our first-generation electric SUV.</p>","<p>It’s easy to copy a part. It’s nearly impossible to copy a deeply integrated system design. This obsession with efficiency means we expect our vehicles to achieve a similar range as competitors with a battery that is up to one-third smaller. The disruption to how we build the vehicle is every bit as important as the product itself. We tore up the century-old concept of the moving assembly line. Instead, we’ve created an \"assembly tree.\"</p>","<p>We will build the vehicle in three separate pieces — the front, the rear, and the structural battery core — and then put them together.</p>","<p>We're confident this is the first time a vehicle will be built like this anywhere in the world.</p>","<h3>The Reason Our Universal Vehicle is Electric</h3>","<p>You might wonder why this platform and vehicle had to be electric. The choice enabled how it is built, and we also believe electric vehicles are by far the best product for the customers we are going after.</p>","<p>You can charge at home, waking up every day with a \"full tank.\"</p>","<p>The vehicle is a mobile power plant with high-power outlets and the ability to provide backup power for your home.</p>","<p>And it will be unbelievably fun to drive, with the low center of gravity from the battery, instant torque from the electric motors, and our obsessive chassis engineering.</p>","<p>Our target is a five-year cost of ownership that will be lower than buying a three-year-old Tesla Model Y — and they are pretty cheap right now.</p>","<p>The first vehicle built on this platform will be a <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-reinvents-vehicle-assembly-new-production-system-platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">midsize, four-door electric pickup truck</a>. It will offer more passenger space than the latest Toyota RAV4, plus a frunk and a truck bed for all the gear that’s part of your life.</p>","<p>And this will not be a stripped-down, old-school vehicle.</p>","<p>Its ground-up, zonal electric architecture not only cuts that mile of wiring but will enable features digital experiences the industry has never seen before. We believe the primary battleground with competitors, especially from China, will be fought and won in the digital realm.</p>","<p>It will also support Ford BlueCruise, the hands-free highway driving system that our customers are already finding transformative.</p>","<p>I don’t think many legacy car manufacturers could pull off a project like this. And I don’t believe new electric vehicle startups will be able to keep up with our Ford engineers and manufacturing teams making this a reality.</p>","<p>New ideas are easy.

Bazzy","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/Richard Headshot .jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>Sometimes the biggest impacts start from the simplest ideas, and then, they just grow. When we first started a scholarship fund here at Shults Ford in the greater Pittsburgh area, the thought was to offer a local student some help with secondary education.</p>","<p>We decided to give a $5,000 scholarship, and that first year, we awarded it to one deserving student.</p>","<p>It felt good to be able to provide that kind of support, knowing how much college or trade school can cost these days. But as we went along, my perspective shifted. We'd receive applications and hear incredible stories from young people who were working hard, dreaming big, and needed a little bit of a boost.</p>","<p>It was during the 2020 pandemic, a time when many students faced anxiety and mental health issues, that I started thinking: <i>Why just one?</i></p>","<p>Why should we have to choose? What about the student whose application came in just past deadline or who didn't quite fit the specific criteria we initially set? It didn't feel right to turn away someone who was putting in the effort. The scholarship fund should aim to support students in overcoming these challenges.</p>","<p>So in year two, we made a decision. A big one — but one that felt right in my gut. We decided that every student who applied would receive the $5,000 scholarship. It didn’t matter if your application was late or you didn’t think you could “win” — if you applied, you got the scholarship.</p>","<p>Seeing the relief and excitement on the faces of these students and their families when they realized this ... well, that's where the real reward is. It's become something truly special, far beyond that first year with just one recipient. In 2025, we gave away 19 scholarships, bringing our total up to 93 since we started.</p>","<h3>Priceless Potential: Lessons Beyond the Money</h3>","<p>Now, if you ask what I hope these students gain beyond the money, that's at the heart of it for me. The financial help is crucial, no doubt, but I hope they gain a few other things, too.</p>","<p>First, I want them to see they can make a difference. They are capable of achieving great things, and this scholarship is just a small affirmation of that.</p>","<p>Second, and this might sound a little strange at first, but I hope they look to me as an example. I graduated from Steel Valley High School right here in Munhall, Pennsylvania. I didn't attend college, so when I say I hope they look to me, I mean I hope they see that success isn't limited to one traditional path. You don't have to go to a four-year university to be successful. I didn’t take that route, and I've found success.</p>","<p>Let me be clear: I’m not telling people not to go to college, not at all. What I am saying is that it's not just what you do — it’s how you do it. Whether they go to college or trade school or choose to chart their own path, I hope they pursue it with passion and hard work.</p>","<p>Finally, perhaps the biggest lesson I hope they take away is this: When you have the ability, you have the responsibility to help others. I truly believe that. If you are in a position to lift someone else up, you should do it. I hope they see this program and understand that principle, and maybe someday, when they have the ability, they will pay it forward in their own way.</p>","<h3>The Heart of Our Mission</h3>","<p>Honestly, these young people are incredible. My team reads their essays first, but I ultimately end up reading every single one that comes through. It's important to me to see the effort these students put in and to get a glimpse into their lives and aspirations.</p>","<p>Supporting high school students in their pursuit of higher education is a profound personal commitment for me. This dedication to fostering growth and opportunity in our communities, particularly through education, is at the very heart of what Ford and its dealer network aim to achieve nationwide. It's the embodiment of +Building Together\" — a shared vision where we collectively empower the next generation and build stronger communities, together.</p>","<p>As I’ve seen the difference the scholarship program has made in my own community, it’s inspired me to replicate it in the communities around my other dealerships. So, looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to expand the program to all four of my Ford dealerships, serving each one's local community. To be able to play a small part in influencing who they become and helping them on their journeys. It's just the most wonderful feeling.</p>","<p>It's been an amazing journey from that first single scholarship to where we are now, and I'm just so grateful to be able to do it because this is who we are and what we do.</p>","<p><i>Richard Bazzy is dealer principal of Richard Bazzy’s Shults Ford in the greater Pittsburgh

Its launch is scheduled for 2027.</p>","<p>“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers,” said Ford President and CEO Jim Farley.<br><br>\n “We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty. So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.”</p>","<h3><b>The Ford Universal EV Platform</b></h3>","<p>The numbers tell the story, Farley said. The platform reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and 15% faster assembly time. Lower cost of ownership over five years than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y.</p>","<p>Take for instance the wiring harness in the new midsize truck; it will be more than 4,000 feet (1.3 kilometers) shorter and 10 kilograms lighter than the one used in our first-gen electric SUV.</p>","<p>Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries also enable space and weight savings, while delivering cost reduction and durability for customers. The platform’s cobalt-free and nickel-free LFP battery pack is a structural sub-assembly that also serves as the vehicle’s floor. This low center of gravity improves handling, creates a quiet cabin, and provides a surprising amount of interior space.</p>","<p>The new midsize truck is forecasted to have more passenger room than the latest Toyota RAV4, even before you include the frunk and the truck bed. You can lock your surfboards or other gear in that bed – no roof rack or trailer hitch racks required.</p>","<p>But it’s not just about space and utility. Ford makes passion products – and this electric vehicle platform with a low center of gravity from the battery, instant torque from electric motors and obsessive chassis engineering will make it fun to drive. The midsize truck will have a targeted 0-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, with more downforce.</p>","<p>“We took inspiration from the Model T – the universal car that changed the world,” said Doug Field, Ford chief EV, digital and design officer. “We assembled a really brilliant collection of minds across Ford and unleashed them to find new solutions to old problems. We applied first‑principles engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn’t a stripped‑down, old‑school vehicle.”</p>","<p>Additional specifications for the midsize electric truck – including reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times – will be communicated later.</p>","<h3><b>The Ford Universal EV Production System</b></h3>","<p>The Ford team obsessed about efficiency in manufacturing, too, transforming the traditional assembly line into an “assembly tree”. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assemblies run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together.</p>","<p>Large single-piece aluminum unicastings replace dozens of smaller parts, enabling the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately.</p>","<p>The front and rear are then combined with the third sub-assembly, the structural battery, which is independently assembled with seats, consoles and carpeting, to form the vehicle.</p>","<p>Parts travel down the assembly tree to operators in a kit. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners and power tools required for the job are included – and in the correct orientation for use.</p>","<p>The Ford Universal EV Production System dramatically improves ergonomics for employees by reducing twisting, reaching and bending, allowing them to focus on the job at hand.</p>","<p>Because of the integration between the Ford Universal EV Production System and Platform, assembly of the midsize electric truck could be up to 40% faster than Louisville Assembly Plant’s current vehicles. Some of that time will be reinvested into insourcing and automation to improve quality and cost, ultimately netting a 15% speed improvement.</p>","<p>“We put our employees at the center and re-created the factory from scratch,” said Bryce Currie, Ford vice president, Americas Manufacturing. “We live and breathe continuous improvement, but sometimes you need a dramatic leap forward. We expect ergonomic breakthroughs and complexity reduction – through elimination of parts, connectors and wire – will flow through to significant quality and cost wins.”</p>","<h3><b>Continued Investment in American Manufacturing</b></h3>","<p>Ford builds on its strong legacy of investing in U.S. vehicle assembly, planning to invest nearly $2 billion in Louisville Assembly Plant to assemble the midsize electric truck, securing 2,200 hourly jobs.</p>","<p>The project is supported by an incentive offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.</p>","<p>“Today, Ford and Team Kentucky are introducing the world to the future of automotive production with nearly $2 billion being invested to transform the Louisville Assembly Plant, which will also secure 2,200 jobs for Kentuckians,” said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. “This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future. Thanks to Ford’s leaders for their continued faith in Kentucky and our incredible workforce. Ford and Kentucky have been a tremendous team for more than 100 years, and that partnership has never been stronger than it is today.”</p>","<p>Louisville Assembly Plant will expand by 52,000 square feet in order to move material more efficiently. Digital infrastructure upgrades will give Louisville Assembly Plant the fastest network with the most access points out of any Ford plant globally, enabling more quality scans.</p>","<p>Ford’s investment in Louisville Assembly Plant is in addition to its previously announced $3 billion investment in BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, which will build the prismatic LFP batteries for the midsize electric truck starting next year. Together, the investments total approximately $5 billion, and between the two plants, Ford expects to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.</p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/ford-affordable-electric-vehicle-platform-starts-with-midsize-truck/ford-electric-vehicle-platform-starts-with-midsize-electric-truck","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:corporate","fordmediasite:vehicle-types/electric-vehicles","fordmediasite:software","fordmediasite:corporate/manufacturing","fordmediasite:vehicle-models"]},{"title":"Ford

It was affordable, adaptable, and serviceable. America would never be the same.</p>","<p>Now, we’re ushering in the next chapter with the Ford Universal EV Platform — a new idea for a new era.</p>","<p>As with the Model T, Ford is again betting big on America. In Louisville, Kentucky, the reinvention of our company begins in earnest, with the implementation of an innovative manufacturing process to bring this platform to life.</p>","<p>We designed this platform to be the foundation for a new generation of electric vehicles. It is flexible enough to underpin trucks, cars, and everything in between.</p>","<p>Vehicles assembled on this platform will be affordable for the average family — but also highly efficient, customizable, and fun to drive. And they won’t be stripped down to the bare essentials.</p>","<p>Instead, these vehicles will be packed with innovative features and new software experiences that set them apart — and make people want to drive them. Better yet, they’ll improve over time with over-the-air updates that continue to add new capabilities where available.</p>","<p>Ford has been able to realize this vision because of a unique formula. We combined more than 120 years of manufacturing experience with the agility and inventiveness of a start-up “skunkworks” engineering team in California.</p>","<p>The result: a new way to assemble vehicles. We’re calling it the Ford Universal EV Production System.</p>","<p>We transformed the traditional assembly line into a tree with three main branches. We’ll assemble the front and rear of the vehicle on separate lines. The third branch is the vehicle’s structural battery, which we’ll pre-assemble with seats, consoles, and carpeting.</p>","<p>These three branches come together at the end, a process that revolutionizes the factory and simplifies work for our employees.</p>","<p>Nothing is more important than the safety of our hourly workers. Not only will this reimagined manufacturing process be faster and require less space, but better ergonomics will result in less twisting, reaching, and straining, allowing them to stay focused on delivering quality for our customers.</p>","<p>Our Louisville-assembled midsize electric truck on this Universal EV Platform will debut in 2027. It will have a target starting MSRP at about $30,000, roughly the same as the Model T when adjusted for inflation.</p>","<p>It will be as quick as a Mustang EcoBoost, and it will have more passenger volume than a 2025 Toyota RAV4 — along with a truck bed, smart cargo and frunk solutions.</p>","<p>Ford is going to deliver what no other automaker has been able to: a family of affordable, adaptable electric vehicles that offer multiple body styles for work and play — including for export — and whose LFP batteries will be assembled in America, not imported from China.</p>","<p>We are investing $5 billion so far in this effort. That includes approximately $2 billion to transform the Louisville Assembly Plant, securing 2,200 jobs while working together with the UAW. At BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, we have committed $3 billion and 1,700 jobs to assemble the LFP batteries these new vehicles will use.</p>","<p>That's nearly 4,000 American jobs.</p>","<p>This is a Model T moment. And it’s bigger than Ford — it's a big win for America’s future and for our customers everywhere.</p>","<p>I’m excited for the world to see the extraordinary vehicles this Universal EV Platform and new manufacturing system will make possible. Ford’s next century of leadership in innovation starts right now. Let’s go!<br></p>","<p><i>Jim Farley is President and CEO of Ford Motor Company.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/ford-reinvents-vehicle-assembly-with-new-production-system-and-platform/ford-reinvents-vehicle-assembly-with-new-production-system-and-platform","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:corporate","fordmediasite:vehicle-types/electric-vehicles","fordmediasite:software","fordmediasite:corporate/manufacturing"]},{"title":"WATCH: Ford's Latest Model T Moment","featuredImage":{"altText":null,"altTextMobile":null,"tags":"","tagsMobile":"","description":"","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":"","mobileContributor":"","mobileCreator":"","mobileRights":"","mobileTitle":"","mobileUsageTerms":"","mobileOwner":"","imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg","imgUrlMobile":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg","alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp"],"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Square.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/Ford_Script_Desktop.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","imgWidth":8000,"imgHeight":4500,"mobileImgWidth":6139,"mobileImgHeight":6139,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":[]},"images":[],"description":"Ford President and CEO Jim Farley, other Ford executives, and special guests share the company's plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America.","tag":"Company News","tags":[{"title":"Company News","name":"fordmediasite:corporate"},{"title":"Vehicles","name":"fordmediasite:vehicle-models"},{"title":"Electric Vehicles","name":"fordmediasite:vehicle-types/electric-vehicles"},{"title":"Manufacturing","name":"fordmediasite:corporate/manufacturing"}],"cta":{"href":"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/get-ready-for-our-next-model-t-moment","optionalClassName":null,"ariaLabel":"WATCH: Ford's Latest Model T Moment","label":"WATCH: Ford's Latest Model T Moment","target":"_self","icon":null,"csr":true},"date":1754924400000,"publishedDate":"2025-08-11","modifiedDate":"2025-08-11 11:01:15-0400","author":{"fullName":"Ford HQ","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/Ford Logo Circle.png"},"paragraphs":["<p>Ford President and CEO Jim Farley, other Ford executives, and special guests share the company's plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America.</p>","<p>Rewatch the entire event below.</p>","<p>Want to keep up with the latest on Ford electric vehicles?</p>","<ol>\n <li>Subscribe to Ford From the Road by clicking the link below</li>\n <li>Select <b>Electric Vehicles</b> as an interest</li>\n <li>Opt in to communications to receive the latest updates</li>\n</ol>","<p>Already subscribed?

That's how long the Ford Bronco has been carving trails through American culture, and honestly, that timeline feels both impossibly long and surprisingly short when you're talking to people who live and breathe this stuff. As we approach the Bronco's 60th anniversary, it's wild to think about how a utilitarian 4x4 that started life in 1966 has evolved into something approaching a religion for its devotees.</p>","<p>I spent time talking to some Bronco obsessives — and I mean that in the most respectful way possible — to understand what makes it so special that people dedicate their entire automotive lives to it. What I found wasn't just car enthusiasm; it was something deeper, more communal, and more generational.</p>","<h3>Tim Hulick and His 14-Bronco Empire</h3>","<p>Picture this: 1977, Virginia Beach. A grade-schooler on a school bus spots a parking lot full of 4x4s. Among all those lifted rigs, one in particular — an early Bronco sitting on what looked like massive tires — catches young Tim Hulick's eye.</p>","<p>\"That's the first time I fell in love with a vehicle,\" he tells me from his Iowa base, where he now keeps his 14 Broncos.</p>","<p>Hulick's collection reads like a Bronco museum manifest: a September 1965-built '66 Roadster with 30,000 original miles that's basically a time capsule, a '66 with what they call a \"pony interior\" (only two known to exist), and a '74 he calls \"Cheeto\" that's painted orange and represents everything he loves about the original Bronco experience. Cheeto is his daily-driver favorite.</p>","<p>His three daughters — Kayley, Morgan, and Cassie — grew up around the vehicles and caught the Bronco bug. When his youngest, Cassie, got one of the first 2021 Broncos in Iowa, Hulick asked her which she preferred, old or new. Her answer is one of the reasons Bronco is attractive across several generations.</p>","<p>\"I like the new ones, but those early Broncos are my favorite,\" she said. \"There's just something about them. They're so unique. You get in them, and it's just a very world-class looking little vehicle that you can't get out of your head.\"</p>","<h3>Jake Gertsch's Nine-Bronco Ranch</h3>","<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/montanabroncos/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jake Gertsch</a> is based in Montana with five kids, and he operates on an entirely different level. Having owned 40 Broncos spanning every generation, he represents something you see a lot in car culture but rarely to this extent: the multi-generational enthusiast who's successfully passed the obsession down to his kids.</p>","<p>\"My first vehicle was a Bronco, and I think that's why I'm still into them today,\" he said. He got his first one, an '83, when he was 16 and has basically never been without one since. But what's fascinating is how he's managed to make Bronco the family's shared language.</p>","<p>His kids can identify Bronco generations on sight. When his daughter Adria got married, they drove away in the family's '73 — the one they call \"The Green Bean.\"</p>","<p>When they're going anywhere as a family, the first question is always, \"Which Bronco should we take?\"</p>","<p>Gertsch's collection ranges from a first-gen vehicle to a Bronco Raptor. He had originally ordered a First Edition, parked it behind his workplace, and then a driver having a seizure slammed into it. It was totaled. Ford couldn't give him another First Edition, but it could get him into the Raptor program. Sometimes automotive destiny works in weird ways.</p>","<p>\"After having a Bronco Raptor, it'd be pretty hard to go to another Bronco,\" he said. His appreciation for next-level performance is crystal clear.</p>","<h3>Tamara Gravelle's Second-Act Adventure</h3>","<p>Tamara Gravelle proves it's never too late to reinvent your relationship with cars. At 60, this retired physician assistant from Michigan had no plans to go off-roading when she ordered her 2021 Wildtrak. Now she's the founder of the Southern Michigan Ladies Bronco Group, which has grown to 543 members, and she's spent $30,000 modifying her Bronco, which she named Fiona after the tough older sister in the TV show \"Shameless.\"</p>","<p>\"I never knew I was going to do any off-roading with it,\" Gravelle said. But then she took a beginner's class, joined the Michigan Bronco Club, and discovered she loves rock climbing. Her favorite memory? Conquering the Marblehead ledges on Drummond Island — something she never thought she would want to do, much less accomplish.</p>","<p>When people ask what her adult kids think about her new hobby, she laughs.</p>","<p>\"They can't believe their 60-year-old mother's out there off-roading and rock climbing and spending all this money,\" she said. \"And I tell them, yeah, I'm spending all your inheritance on my Bronco.\"</p>","<h3>Casey Wagoner's 94,000-Mile Love Story</h3>","<p>Casey Wagoner represents the current iteration of Bronco enthusiasm — the people who got 2021s and immediately started pushing them to their limits. Based in Michigan, Wagoner has put 94,000 miles on his 2021 Bronco, and not gentle highway miles. We're talking about Moab expeditions and technical rock crawling.</p>","<p>His recent trip to Moab with his 15-year-old son tells you everything you need to know about where Bronco culture is heading. They tackled Hell's Revenge, Poison Spider, Golden Spike, and made it through half of Pritchett Canyon.</p>","<p>But the underrated story here is one of comfort: Despite 25 hours driving back from Moab, Wagoner never felt uncomfortable in the seat. That's the synthesis of 60 years of Bronco evolution right there — the capability that people expect since the originals with the refinement of modern engineering.</p>","<p>\"It is by far the most comfortable vehicle I've ever owned,\" said Wagoner. He's owned multiple Broncos, including an '86 — his first-ever vehicle.<br></p>","<h3>Kiesha Foulds and Her Hot Pink Statement</h3>","<p>Kiesha Foulds, a nurse from central Pennsylvania, has been building her automotive empire since she was 18. She currently owns 16 vehicles, 13 of which are classics that would make most enthusiasts green with envy.</p>","<p>But it all started with one hot pink '73 Bronco and a stepdad who had a serious Bronco problem.</p>","<p>\"My stepdad always had them,\" she said. \"We had like 40-some of them in the yard. He daily drove a '79, my mom daily drove a '78, and I always wanted one.\"</p>","<p>At 18, she browsed through the yard, picked out a '73, and paid her stepdad $1,500 for it. Next, she began her first frame-off restoration, done while she was in nursing school, learning everything as she went.</p>","<p>\"I originally wanted to do orange, and when I was browsing Google Images just for different orange colors, somehow a pink car ended up in the mix,” she said. “I didn't even like pink back then, but I was like, oh my gosh, I need to do that type of pink.\"</p>","<p>The result is impossible to miss: a hot pink '73 Bronco that's become her calling card at events across the country. She's taken it to 47 states, done overlanding trips with Ford, and built an impressive collection — all while keeping up with a busy nursing career.</p>","<p>Foulds isn’t just building cars, though. She's building community, particularly for women who might feel intimidated by the traditionally male-dominated automotive world.</p>","<p>\"I have friends that are girls or other nurses or anybody really,” she said. “I've taught them how to change their oil on their vehicles and that type of stuff. And I see them light up with how empowered they feel just 'cause they can change their oil.\"</p>","<h3>Amy Clouds and the Off-Roadeo Revolution</h3>","<p>Amy Clouds brings a different perspective to Bronco culture. She's one of the people literally teaching others how to use these things properly. Based at Ford's Bronco Off-Roadeo facility in Texas, she's a trail guide who helps people discover what their Broncos (and they themselves) are capable of.</p>","<p>Clouds got into Broncos through her husband, Mike, who's been in the scene since the early '90s and is now president of the Lone Star Early Bronco Club. She’s seen the evolution of the community first-hand.</p>","<p>\"Even before the 6th Gen Bronco was launched, the Bronco community was very tight-knit, very close,\" she says. \"That has not changed, but what has changed is just how much it has exploded. There are so many more clubs, so many more people who are active in it.\"</p>","<p>Clouds has some incredible stories about helping people overcome their fears. Amanda, for example, had been in a terrible rollover accident and never thought she'd be able to off-road again, but she found the Off-Roadeo experience therapeutic and empowering. Similarly, a gentleman who had PTSD from a vehicle accident was able to conquer obstacles that once looked impossible.</p>","<p>\"It was life-changing for him,\" Clouds said. \"He equated it to so many other things in life that look like you can't do it; they look like you can't conquer it. But once you just keep pushing through and trying, you end up doing it.\"</p>","<h3>Jürgen and Alexandra's Three-Year Odyssey</h3>","<p>Perhaps the most ambitious Bronco story comes from an unlikely place: Cologne, Germany, where Jürgen Walleneit and Alexandra Rondorf are about to embark on a <a href=\"https://www.kaufkraft.de/milesmeetsmoments\" rel=\"nofollow\">three-year, around-the-world journey</a> in a Bronco that will serve as both their home and their office.</p>","<p>They found their Bronco on Facebook, sold by a Slovakian owner who called it his \"third child\" but needed to sell it due to family space constraints.</p>","<p>\"We had to convince him that we are the right people for his baby,\" Walleneit said of their WhatsApp video call interview process.</p>","<p>Interestingly, they chose Bronco not for emotional reasons but for purely practical ones.</p>","<p>\"The repairability all around the world,\" Walleneit said. \"This car, you can repair it in every country we will go. You don't have so many models in the car industry you can drive around the world.\"</p>","<p>The pair has launched a YouTube channel called \"Meets Moments\" to document their journey, and they're planning to work with German entrepreneurs around the world, creating content and organizing events while living and working from their Bronco for three years.</p>","<p>It's a perfect example of how Bronco culture has evolved from American off-road icon to global platform for adventure, work, and life.</p>","<h3>The Culture, Not Just the Car</h3>","<p>Here's what struck me most about these conversations: None of these owners are really talking about cars. They're talking about a culture that's managed to sustain itself across six decades and six completely different generations of vehicles — and one that’s enabled them to discover new things about themselves.</p>","<p>The automotive landscape has been completely transformed multiple times since 1966. But Bronco culture has this weird ability to absorb change while maintaining its core DNA. Hulick can take a stock 1966 to 13,000 feet in Colorado and keep up with modified rigs. Gertsch can put his '78 next to his Raptor and they look like they belong together. Wagoner can daily drive a 2021 and feel connected to the same ethos that created the original.</p>","<p>\"When I pull into the gas station and somebody comes over, they always have a story,\" Gertsch tells me. \"Even if they didn't own a Bronco. They're like, 'Oh, my uncle had one just like that.' Everyone has a story with Bronco, whether it was their parents or their grandpa or their uncle or their neighbor.\"</p>","<p>As Bronco hits 60, we’re celebrating six decades of a culture that's managed to stay relevant while staying true to itself. In a world where everything feels disposable and temporary, that's remarkable.</p>","<p>And if you don't understand the appeal, well, as Hulick puts it: \"You're either gonna love it or you're not. You need to get behind the wheel. You need to ride in one and see what happens.\"</p>","<p>Sixty years in, and we're still making converts one drive at a time.</p>","<p><i>Jason Hyde is Bronco brand manager at

Ryan","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/authors/author-images/ted ryan.jpeg"},"paragraphs":["<p>It’s well known that Ford sold millions of Model T cars around the world, but it was so much more than just a best-selling product. It was capable, affordable, easy to drive and repair — and it literally put the world on wheels by making personal transportation accessible to the masses.</p>","<p>Known as ‘the Universal Car’ because of its versatility, the Model T was brought to life in a secret third-floor room of the historic Piquette Plant in Detroit. Behind a locked and sealed door, a small team of select individuals, including Edsel Ford and Henry Ford himself, experimented with various propulsion methods, developed a planetary transmission system and perfected the magneto.</p>","<p>They took this secretive approach because, even at that time, the competitive landscape of the early automotive industry was ferocious. Every bicycle maker in America thought that they could add two more wheels and an engine and suddenly have themselves a car. As the No. 1 automaker in the U.S. at the time, Ford had a lot to lose.</p>","<p>As the company pumped out other alphabetized models such as the popular Model N, Henry Ford had a vision for the expansion of personal transportation with a car for the masses.</p>","<p><b>Putting the ‘U’ in universal</b></p>","<p>The Model T was more than a single model or body style — it was a flexible platform. With their capability, reliability and repairability, some early Model Ts were fodder for stunts like driving to the top of Pike’s Peak in the Rocky Mountains, climbing the stairs of a courthouse or competing in a cross-country race from New York to Seattle along the nation’s primitive roads, a contest it won over other higher-powered competitors.</p>","<p>The utilitarian Model T proved itself invaluable in countless everyday scenarios of the 1910s and ’20s, too. It was adapted for use by first responders such as fire trucks and ambulances, and it was at home on the farm powering machinery or sausage grinders. The car could even be transformed into a snowmobile for use by farmers and loggers by replacing the front wheels with snow skis and swapping the rear wheels for caterpillar tracks.</p>","<p>While color choices for the Model T were famously limited in order to keep production running smoothly during its peak, the car was offered in different body styles such as the Tudor Sedan, Fordor Sedan, Coupe, Touring Car and Runabout. Ford also sold a heavy-duty Model TT truck chassis for commercial customers, while the Model T Runabout offered a pickup body beginning in 1925. It was the company’s first factory-produced pickup.</p>","<p><b>Picking up the pace</b></p>","<p>The proliferation of the Model T came with the introduction of the moving assembly line in 1913 — some five years after the vehicle’s introduction. In its early years at Piquette, the Model T was assembled at different stations located throughout the building. It’s difficult to imagine today just how arduous that process must have been. The assembly line was later applied at the Model T’s second home, Ford’s Highland Park plant, vastly speeding the production process.</p>","<p>While moving assembly had been used before in the meatpacking industry and assembling rifles, Ford perfected the concept. No one else had anything approaching what Ford was doing at that time.</p>","<p>There was also another key ingredient to the success of the moving assembly line. Production was also made more efficient by the introduction of the sub-assembly process, which saw parts such as radiators and steering wheels delivered to the workers on the assembly line as they were needed. The savings created by producing the Model T at scale were passed on to consumers, and affordable personal transportation quickly spread around the world.</p>","<p><b>Full circle</b></p>","<p>Now Ford is going back to its roots for another Model T moment. Ford leaders will share more about our plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America. <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/get-ready-for-our-next-model-t-moment\" rel=\"nofollow\">Join Monday, Aug. 11 at 10:20 a.m. EDT</a> for a special livestream to learn more.</p>","<p><i>Ted Ryan is Heritage and Brand manager at Ford.</i></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2025/the-model-t--born-in-secrecy,-built-for-the-world-/the-model-t--born-in-secrecy,-built-for-the-world","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:business-unit/heritage-vault","fordmediasite:corporate/manufacturing","fordmediasite:vehicle-models","fordmediasite:corporate"]},{"title":"One v One: Max Verstappen Takes on the Mustang GTD","featuredImage":{"altText":"Max Verstappen and Chris Harris are pictured during the Max Verstappen & Ford at Circuit du Sambuc on May 15, 2025 in Aix-en-Provance, France.

It has been how I have made my living for decades now. I have even done a fair amount of racing in some proper machinery over the years including most recently at Le Mans in a Mustang. But every so often, I’m humbled. Riding shotgun with four-time Formula 1 World Driver’s Champion Max Verstappen as he laces an 815-horsepower Ford Mustang GTD around a small French racetrack goes beyond humbling.</p>","<p>I’m in the south of France talking to Verstappen about driving, exploring the countryside and trying to understand his philosophy on cornering, specifically, and driving more generally.</p>","<p>Verstappen is an unassuming figure for all he’s accomplished. If we’re talking about the spectrum of F1 superstar drivers, he’s neither the cerebral Niki Lauda nor the playboy James Hunt. But he is a pure driver, as likely to stay up all night on his home sim for an endurance race as he is to enter a GT3 race under an assumed name or dominate a Formula 1 race. And regardless of what or where or how he’s driving, he is blisteringly, relentlessly quick.</p>","<p>That starts with how he seemingly shakes down a racetrack. Max doesn’t tiptoe around, trying to memorize the layout and braking points and apexes as a whole, but by devouring each individual corner while exploring where the grip is and where the grip isn’t. Verstappen brutalizes the track, poking and prodding until it gives up its secrets so he can go as fast as possible.</p>","<p>The Mustang GTD is a vehicle that’s quite happy with this sort of driving. A track-ready weapon, Verstappen immediately gets up to speed with the power delivery, the fantastic damper performance over the rough French surface, and the power of its standard carbon-ceramic brakes, just as he gets up to speed with the track. As he’s exploring the track’s limits, he’s also exploring the car’s.</p>","<p>Mechanical grip from the big tires feels endless as Max bounds over the curbs and the occasional smile that breaks through as he does so shows how much fun he’s having. It’s clear even from the passenger’s seat that he’s the rare driver that’s equal to a car of this caliber. Or perhaps that the Mustang GTD is that rarest of cars that can actually challenge and reward one of the greatest race drivers of his generation.</p>","<p>Either way, the abiding memory I will have will be of a delightful young man displaying his superhuman talent in a car that both of us will not forget in a hurry.

Our state-of-the-art lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cell production equipment is already operational, producing C-sample cells at our equipment supplier location off-site.</p>","<p>Having this work done and team members trained in parallel speeds up the commissioning process once the equipment arrives at the new plant in Marshall, Michigan. These C-sample cells (the last prototype cells before production readiness) will soon be used for design-confirmation sign-off in our next-generation electric vehicle program.</p>","<p>After the equipment is installed in the plant, we can effectively seal off areas of the facility and — using strict protocols — we can transition in stages to \"clean room\" status. This makes it an opportune time to see the cutting-edge factory — which spans almost a mile long — taking shape.</p>","<p>This facility represents a historic step: An American automotive company is manufacturing — without relying on a foreign joint venture — LFP battery cells and battery packs domestically with American workers for American-assembled next-generation electric vehicles. We remain on track to start production of these prismatic LFP batteries next year.</p>","<p>Our ambition for vertical integration in the right places within our battery supply chain remains a key priority and is critical for future success. The scale of the facility is also key to unlock the cost benefits. We are bringing home to the U.S. the innovation that escaped our industry decades ago, and the result is we will not have to rely on imports in a continually changing global trade environment.</p>","<p>For our customers, we’re focused on delivering increased value at a lower cost. Regardless of battery chemistry, we are innovating to enhance safety, energy density and charging times, while simultaneously working to drive down cost to offer more affordable electric vehicles. LFP chemistry is generally considered the lowest-cost technology for automotive application currently available, which is why BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is strategically important.</p>","<p>To really deliver truly affordable electric vehicles to our customers, we made a decision years ago to fully invest in a new facility with world-class LFP production technology installed in the U.S. for the first time — wholly owned and operated by Ford. This allows us to integrate cutting-edge innovation while building expertise and retaining control that will lay the foundation for future battery manufacturing in the U.S. — allowing the U.S. to finally build LFP batteries at scale and pave the way to compete globally on energy storage production.</p>","<p>Ford has invested $3 billion in BlueOval Battery Park Michigan.

Langley, England, and the very first Ford Transit rolls off the production line. I don’t think any of us could have predicted the impact the van would have on businesses, the economy, and our everyday lives. For the past 60 years, vans in all shapes and sizes, including the Transit, have been at the heart of Europe’s economic growth.</p>","<p>It’s tricky to quantify just how much impact Transit has had on us. But if businesses that depend on vans formed an EU member state, their national output would be the 6th largest. That would put it ahead of Sweden, Ireland and Austria.<sup>1 </sup>In fact, in 2023 the amount van-related businesses contributed to the EU and UK economies was €1 Trillion, and Transit would have helped to play a significant role in that.</p>","<p>What was the secret of success for that first Transit back in 1965? Like footwear, one van size doesn’t fit all so, the product was conceived with a comprehensive range of models to meet the differing needs of business customers. Very soon after the initial launch we not only added longer versions of its panel van to the Transit range, but also chassis cab variants, allowing specialist converters to build bespoke vehicles exactly to customer requirements.</p>","<p>You needed a Luton van for house removals? Transit had you covered. You ran a scout group, or needed to move goods and people to site? Passenger carrying minibuses and dual-purpose Kombi Transits rapidly became available.</p>","<p>Looking back, I think that vans from other manufacturers had often been marketed on a ‘what you see is what you get’ basis but, from the outset, Transit was designed with the real-world user in mind. A flat loadspace floor made it easy for the driver to load and unload the van, and a forward-mounted engine allowed for a more comfortable, spacious cab which didn’t intrude into the loadspace.</p>","<p>I’m sure that we’re all familiar with seeing Transits that bear the logos of big, well-known firms such as parcel delivery companies or utility services, but, 99 per cent of firms in the EU are classed as small businesses. Throughout these 60 years we’ve continued to develop Transit, recognising the needs of smaller enterprises and their critical importance to the economy.</p>","<p>Flexibility and a rapid response to customer demands became an intrinsic part of our operation, and as a result fleet customers quickly adopted the Transit.</p>","<p>Across Europe, companies responsible for vital infrastructure such as power and railways together with emergency services introduced the vehicle to their fleets. They could take advantage of our <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/eur/en/articles/2025/probably-one-of-my-most-unusual-van-builds-yet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Special Vehicle Operations</a> department when their requirements were for vans to carry out unique roles, needing bespoke equipment.</p>","<p>Our Ford Pro customers come in almost infinite shapes, sizes, trades and professions. Take <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/eur/en/articles/2025/a-business-creating-some-buzz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gwenyn Gruffydd</a>, a honey supplier based in deepest Wales, UK. Owner Gruffydd Rees operates from multiple counties across the region and maintains over 400 beehives. He uses a Ford Transit Custom van to take products to farmers markets, and to deliver equipment to customers.</p>","<p>We’re all used to being connected, 24/7 and the Transit family is no exception with all vehicles fitted with an integrated modem. Services such as the FORDLiive connected uptime system, Ford Pro Telematics and even the FordPass app for the driver help to improve efficiency and keep unscheduled, and expensive, downtime to a minimum.

This benefits us all.<br></p>","<p>And when it comes to electrification, it's estimated that <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/eur/en/articles/2024/small-businesses-could-save--14-000-per-van-by-going-electric\" rel=\"nofollow\">small businesses could save €14,000 per van</a> over three years by making the switch. Here at Ford Pro we are perfectly placed to continue being a trusted business partner to our customers, with fully electric E-Transit Courier<sup>2</sup>, E-Transit Custom<sup>3</sup> and E-Transit<sup>4 </sup>all available to increase efficiency and reduce costs.<br></p>","<p>But, making the transition to electric vans isn’t purely about cost savings. Businesses also want to partner with their communities, displaying a commitment to operating in an environmentally friendly way. <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/eur/en/articles/2025/running-on-tradition\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heidinger Bakery</a> in Frankfurt is such a company.</p>","<p></p>","<p>Here at Ford Pro, all of us who are involved with the design, manufacture, sales and support of the Transit are incredibly proud of how for 60 years the van has been at the heart of the European economy. Through thick and thin the van has supported both businesses and economic growth and we have all either directly or indirectly benefitted.

I drive a street truck myself and am currently working on a 1995 Ranger drift truck, so I know this world. These vehicles have been a part of my life for years.</p>","<p>So, when it came time to imagine an F-150 Lobo — on the heels of helping create the new Maverick Lobo last year — I didn’t have to look far to know what prospective customers would want.</p>","<p>Drop it.</p>","<p>Give it V8 sound and performance. Make dual exhaust tips standard. Add aggressive styling.</p>","<p>And give it a face that looks ... sinister.</p>","<p>The project represented a new application of the Lobo name, one that was born in 1997 by Ford of Mexico. Lobo aligns with the truck's aggressive, street-inspired identity and carries significant heritage.</p>","<p>Incidentally, I was born at about the same time, so this is not a case of me recalling the trucks of my youth and infusing that style into a new product. Born and raised in New Hampshire, it wasn’t until I came to Detroit to study at the College for Creative Studies that my love of street trucks was born. And there’s no place like Detroit to ignite a passion for cars and trucks.</p>","<p>Our team knows what the street truck crowd wants because we’ve seen their trucks. Continuing what Maverick Lobo started last year, the F-150 Lobo is designed to serve a new segment of potential F-150 customers. For years, they have been taking factory pickup trucks and lowering them. Adding more power. Leaning on street styling. From an automaker, this has been an untapped market for two decades.</p>","<p>So, on the bones of the Built Ford Tough F-150 truck, we created a street truck that rolls off the line ready to roar, with proven durability and a Ford factory limited warranty for more confidence and peace of mind than aftermarket solutions.</p>","<p>F-150 Lobo is a package on STX, comes as a SuperCrew, and is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 engine that puts out 400 horsepower and 410 lb.-ft. of torque, which is already a superstar in the street truck community. And, we’ve included our upgraded two-speed automatic 4WD system. The challenge for our design team was making the truck look as aggressive as it drives and sounds.</p>","<p>Street truck culture is about looks and performance, and that’s where things got fun for us.</p>","<p>Already lower than a base F-150 with an updated suspension that drops the rear of the truck 2 inches, we added a 10-piece ground appearance package that visually lowers the truck even more. As part of the body kit, Lobo gets a wide gloss-black mesh lower grille.</p>","<p>A unique upper grille gives F-150 Lobo an unmistakable face on the road. When you see its grille and light bar rolling up behind you in the rearview mirror, you’ll know.</p>","<p>To best capture today’s popular street styling, we added black-accented exterior features such as hood vents, exhaust, and badging, not to mention unique Lobo 22-inch gloss-black wheels.</p>","<p>For an even more aggressive look, we equipped F-150 Lobo with a cowl hood. Updated headlamps draw a family line with Maverick Lobo, and the taillamps are upgraded from the STX Package for a premium look.</p>","<p>The new F-150 Lobo is available in five exterior colors — Agate Black Metallic, Atlas Blue Metallic, Carbonized Gray, Oxford White, and Rapid Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat — helping customers give their truck the personality they desire. The all-black version looks straight menacing.</p>","<p>We built Lobo to be the powerful and stylish street truck enthusiasts truly want, from the factory. We integrated significant, often costly modifications and handled the updates typically challenging for owners, delivering a complete foundation straight off the line. While Lobo is ready for the road just as it is, we know some will take this great foundation for future personalization.</p>","<p>This is a solution that comes straight from Ford.

It includes a GT front fascia, specific black-painted wheels and exterior trim, and red-painted brake calipers.</li>\n <li>New wheel options are added, including a 19-inch high-gloss Dark Carbonized Gray-painted aluminum wheel with white graphics (optional on Rally) and 19-inch monochromatic high-gloss black-painted aluminum wheels (part of the Sport Appearance Package and optional on Select).</li>\n <li>The sporty GT model comes standard with 20-inch monochromatic high-gloss black-painted aluminum wheels.</li>\n <li>For added convenience, the key fob now has a button specifically for releasing the 'frunk' (the front trunk).</li>\n <li>The GT model gets a new design for its grille shield. This is also part of the Sport Appearance Package on Premium models.</li>\n <li>Front recovery hooks are standard on all models. They are smartly stowed under the load floor near the tire mobility kit.</li>\n <li>Two new exterior colors are added to the palette: Desert Sand and Molten Magenta Metallic Tinted Clearcoat.</li>\n <li>On Premium models, several exterior elements are revised. The front and rear lower fascias and door cladding change from black-painted to black molded-in-color. The door moldings change from previously black to body-color molded-in-color, and the wheellip moldings also become body-color (replacing black-painted ones).</li>\n <li>On extended-range models, the 'X' badge is removed from the 'Mach-E X' door badges, except for models equipped with the Bronze Appearance Package.</li>\n</ul>","<h3>Interior Updates</h3>","<ul>\n <li>The rotary gear selector dial is replaced by a monostable (stalk) shifter.</li>\n <li>The finish panel on top of the center console is revised.</li>\n <li>The graphics in the instrument cluster also are updated.</li>\n <li>Ventilatedfront seats are included on Premium models.</li>\n <li>The 'frunk' is redesigned and features additional Ford Integrated Tether System (FITS) slots, which can be useful for securing items.</li>\n</ul>","<h3>Technology &amp; Connectivity</h3>","<ul>\n <li>Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) is enhanced with the addition of Oncoming detection.</li>\n <li>The Ford BlueCruise hands-free driving system sees some changes.

I like the freedom of being out on the open road and meeting new people. In August, I drove from Germany to Italy to meet with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ford-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Pro</a> employees, customers, dealers, and upfitters. While my main goal was to listen and learn, my daughter Grace joined me, and we also had a lot of fun traversing the Continent together.</p>","<p>I was pleased to see Transit vans are as ubiquitous on the roads of Europe as they are in North America. Transit is the world’s bestselling cargo van, after all, and van-based businesses — like plumbers, electricians, and road builders — accounted for an estimated €1 trillion in economic activity across the EU and UK in 2023. It’s these work-ready vans, plus pickup trucks like Ford F-Series and Ranger, that are fueling Ford Pro’s growth and enabling the businesses that are the backbone of our communities.</p>","<p>I drove the 500-mile journey in the all-new electric Ford E-Transit Custom and its plug-in hybrid variant. Ford is committed to decarbonisation and we are investing billions to bring exciting new electrified products like these to our retail and commercial customers. The appetite to electrify in Europe is high, but like elsewhere the road to zero emission, transportation is highly challenging, and governments must do more to support more fleets and families to make the switch so ambitious CO2 industry targets can be met.</p>","<p>I wanted to experience firsthand the difficulties and opportunities businesses of all sizes face as they go electric, and how Ford Pro’s ecosystem can support them. Here are the 5 key takeaways from my trip.</p>","<h3>1. Commercial vehicle customers in Europe are embracing electrification</h3>","<p>Many businesses in Europe are going electric not just for the environmental impact, but to lower their total cost of ownership and improve productivity. They want the best tools for the job, and vehicles are no different. They are doing the math, and with an electric vehicle, their fuel costs go down, and there’s less need for maintenance and service, boosting uptime. The key challenge for commercial customers is figuring out which vehicles in their fleets they should electrify first and what the charging needs will be. Ford Pro is there to help. For example, we have a free tool called E-Switch Assist that figures out which vehicle in a fleet is ready to electrify based on its daily charging needs.</p>","<h3>2. Hybrids are a great transitional technology on the path to all-electric</h3>","<p>Customers want a range of powertrain solutions. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jim-farley_fordpro-activity-7235345209612513281-e7Ee?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">I met with Fröschl</a>, an Austrian construction company that uses Rangers to go up mountains to fix infrastructure. With the high altitudes and inclement weather, they will be sticking with diesel and hybrids for the foreseeable future. I drove the Transit Custom PHEV on day 3 because its extended range and torque was the best choice to get me through the steep climbs in the Alps. Ford’s future direction is clear: We will optimize for pure electric vehicles. But it’s also clear that hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and partial electric vehicles are attractive low-carbon solutions that will coexist with electric vehicles longer than anyone previously thought.</p>","<h3>3. Improving charging infrastructure is key to electric vehicle adoption</h3>","<p>The least of my problems on the road in Europe was charging. There were plenty of fast chargers on our route in working condition and with spots available. It was a totally different experience than when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wH7LEfaEJE&amp;t=5s\" rel=\"nofollow\">I drove the F-150 Lightning across California last year</a>. One of the key reasons electric vehicle adoption has stalled in the U.S. is a lack of charging, especially for long distance drives. There’s still more work to be done in Europe and bolder investment needed by policymakers to get to mass coverage, but I was excited by the existing charging options I saw and how reliable access lowers range anxiety.</p>","<h3>4. Commercial customers are super users of software and services</h3>","<p>Increasingly, digital experiences are a key brand differentiator. I was pleased to hear how much our Ford Pro customers love our software and services because they make the transition to electrification easier, increase productivity, and save costs. Like uptime solutions that use connected data to optimize fleets and maintenance. Combined with mobile service vans that can repair multiple vehicles in one visit. And telematics — <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jim-farley_fordpro-telematics-fordmotorcompany-activity-7239307308885848065-wYue?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">which I used myself on this road trip</a> that can pre-condition your vehicle, give you charging alerts, and coach drivers to avoid negative driving behavior. It can also quantify cost saving and CO2 reduction of a fleet. Our next-gen commercial vehicles will be even smarter, adding new features like prognostics that can predict the failure of components before they happen. Commercial customers are the super users of software and services for our industry because keeping their vehicles on the road has tangible business value, and this know-how will eventually benefit our retail customers, too.</p>","<h3>5. The importance of going and seeing for yourself</h3>","<p>I learned the value of “Gemba” when I worked at Toyota — seeing things with your own eyes and listening to the people doing the actual work. I am often surrounded by team members who tell me everything is fine. Hearing feedback directly, on issues large and small, helps me jumpstart the process on fixes. I always ask simple questions, like what’s working, what isn’t? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jim-farley_dhl-fordmotorcompany-fordpro-activity-7233909894758739968-6uUm?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">I met with the head of DHL</a> — which is going 60% electric globally. They love our E-Transits but want the charging port at the back of the vehicle instead of at the front. At one of our largest commercial vehicle dealerships in Germany, I learned about some product delays and a taillight issue that were news to me. Doing a Gemba trip lets you understand the problem, find the right solution, and make better business decisions.</p>","<p>I’ve returned to the U.S. with great confidence in our Ford+ strategy, but also with a long list of to-dos and clear eyed about the challenges ahead to meet our shared societal goals.</p>","<p>Ford Pro is at the forefront of our transformation into a leader of electric and connected vehicles — and it embodies what we can achieve when we focus on our strengths.</p>","<p>We know work customers better than anyone else. That insight has earned us the #1 commercial vehicle brand spot in Europe and the U.S. But our competitors aren’t sitting still. And to win in the future requires humility and a commitment to continuous improvement.</p>","<p></p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/5-lessons-learned-on-the-road-in-europe/5-lessons-learned-on-the-road-in-europe","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:content-type/jim-farley-from-the-road"]},{"title":"Notes from Ford Pro Go & See Week Europe: Day 3 Diary","featuredImage":{"altText":"Jim Farley speaking to the Parolini family at the Iperauto S.p.A dealership.","altTextMobile":null,"tags":"","tagsMobile":null,"description":"Jim Farley speaking to the Parolini family at the Iperauto S.p.A dealership.","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":null,"mobileContributor":null,"mobileCreator":null,"mobileRights":null,"mobileTitle":null,"mobileUsageTerms":null,"mobileOwner":null,"imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg","imgUrlMobile":null,"alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":null,"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":null,"defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":null,"defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":null,"defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":null,"defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2024/notes-from-ford-pro-go-and-see-week-europe-day-3-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (8) (1).jpeg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":null,"imgWidth":1280,"imgHeight":853,"mobileImgWidth":0,"mobileImgHeight":0,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":null},"images":[],"description":"Onto day 3 on the road.

Incredible landscapes!</p>","<p>8:15 AM - Stopped at the famous ski resort Axamer Lizum, near Innsbruck, to visit Fröschl, a Ford Pro customer and family business. Their lines of business include construction of roads, cable cars buildings, hotels and commercial buildings, residential buildings, and railways. The mountain landscape is a challenge but Eduard Fröschl, Jr. explained how their fleet of Ford &amp; Ford Pro vehicles helps them get the job done. Amazing view for work!</p>","<p>9:10 AM - My daughter Grace and I took a few moments to enjoy the gorgeous view after riding up in a cable car to the top of the mountain.

Check it out:</p>","<p>6:00 AM – We started the morning bright and early. America’s most famous road and America’s most popular truck. This is what it looks like when America goes electric. And I’m passionate about ensuring that the transition is a good one for everyone — for my son’s generation and the ones that come after him.</p>","<p>8:00 AM – We stopped for a charge in Baker, CA — the gateway to Death Valley. This was the one and only 350kw fast charger I found on my trip. It was a great experience, so much faster than the other chargers I’ve been using. There were also a ton of Tesla Superchargers nearby, and it’s a good reminder both of why we’re working with Tesla to open that network to Ford drivers, and that that alone won’t solve the problems our customers face.</p>","<p>And what’s a road trip without some fun novelties like the World’s Tallest Thermometer!</p>","<p>11:30 AM – My next stop was Bronco Off-Roadeo Nevada, where I checked out the all-new Bronco Raptor Valley experience. Vaughn Gittin Jr. was there to show me and Jaimo the course he helped design!</p>","<p>I hope you can get out to try Bronco-Off Roadeo if you haven’t. It blew me away, and I know it can be so valuable for us, because customers walk away absolutely fired up about their vehicles. We’re going to work with our dealers to make our four Off-Roadeo sites the most famous brand experience in America.</p>","<p>3:30 PM – Next on my trip was Vegas! Couldn’t miss a stop at Gaudin Ford, which has been serving their community for 101 years. The most beautiful part is they often sell vehicles to multiple generations from the same families. As Gary told me, “The sales department only buys the family their very first car. The service department sells the family every car they buy after that.”</p>","<p>And it was great to see my buddy Gary Ackerman again, owner of Gaudin. It was his grandfather, George, who founded the dealership in 1922. It’s been family owned and operated ever since. A terrific legacy.</p>","<p>4:00 PM – Then it was time for me and Gary to head to the headquarters of the Las Vegas Raiders, where I got to deliver a new Mustang Mach-E to Jamie Gary, a Raiders employee. It’s her first EV! She was kind enough to give me a fun memento in return.</p>","<p>We also surprised Jamie with three-years of complimentary BlueCruise. I’ve been driving with it myself on this trip. It’s been a great chance to understand some of what BlueCruise does great and what kinds of opportunities we have. I know Jamie’s really going to love it.</p>","<p>6:00 PM – It wasn’t unexpected, but charging was one of the biggest challenges of the trip. I learned a lot from my experience, and from talking to customers and our dealer partners about theirs. Between our deal to get Ford EV drivers access to over 12,000 Tesla Superchargers and the investments we are making in our own BlueOval Charging Network, a stronger charging experience is around the corner.</p>","<p>Thanks for following along as I’ve shared my experiences on the road! I’ve learned a lot that will really help us as we navigate this digital and electric transition as a team. And I’m inspired by all the examples I hear of all of you getting out to “Go and See” and talk to our colleagues, our dealer partners, and the customers we serve. It’s going to be absolutely crucial as we keep pushing to deliver our Ford+ plan.</p>"],"path":null,"main":null,"shortTitle":null,"shortDescription":null,"citation":null,"citationLink":null,"footnotes":null,"fragmentPath":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road-go-and-see-week-day-3-diary/notes-from-the-road---go-&-see-week-2023-day-3-diary","location":null,"cqTags":["fordmediasite:content-type/jim-farley-from-the-road"]},{"title":"Notes from the Road | Go & See Week Day 1 Diary","featuredImage":{"altText":"Jim Farley drives using BlueCruise in his F-150 Lightning.","altTextMobile":null,"tags":"","tagsMobile":null,"description":"Jim Farley drives using BlueCruise in his F-150 Lightning.","contributor":"","creator":"","rights":"","title":"","usageTerms":"","owner":"","mobileDescription":null,"mobileContributor":null,"mobileCreator":null,"mobileRights":null,"mobileTitle":null,"mobileUsageTerms":null,"mobileOwner":null,"imgUrl":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg","imgUrlMobile":null,"alignment":null,"alignmentMobile":null,"defaultSrcSet":["/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.640.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.768.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.1440.webp","/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.web.2400.webp"],"mobileSrcSet":null,"defaultSrcSquare":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.square.webp","mobileSrcSquare":null,"defaultSrcTall":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.tall.webp","mobileSrcTall":null,"defaultSrcWide":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.wide.webp","mobileSrcWide":null,"defaultSrcStandard":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/jcr:content/renditions/cqdam.standard.webp","mobileSrcStandard":null,"defaultSrcLowRes":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road--go-and-see-week-day-1-diary/cq5dam.web.1280.1280 (12).jpeg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg","mobileSrcLowRes":null,"imgWidth":1200,"imgHeight":675,"mobileImgWidth":0,"mobileImgHeight":0,"imageMap":[],"mobileImageMap":null},"images":[],"description":"This week I’m out on the road in an F-150 Lightning to kick off Go and See Week.","tag":"Jim Farley From the Road","tags":[{"title":"Jim Farley From the Road","name":"fordmediasite:content-type/jim-farley-from-the-road"}],"cta":{"href":"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2023/notes-from-the-road-go-and-see-week-2023-day-1-diary","optionalClassName":null,"ariaLabel":"Notes from the Road | Go & See Week 2023 Day 1 Diary","label":"Notes from the Road | Go & See Week 2023 Day 1 Diary","target":"_self","icon":null,"csr":true},"date":1691593200000,"publishedDate":"2023-08-09","modifiedDate":"2025-08-20 12:09:48-0400","author":{"fullName":"Jim Farley","image":"/content/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/profiles/images/James-D-Farley-Jr.jpg"},"paragraphs":["<p>This week I’m out on the road in an F-150 Lightning to kick off Go and See Week. I had a great first day of learning from our colleagues, dealers, and customers — and helping to power a carnival along the way!</p>","<p>8:00 AM – I kicked off my trip by meeting with our ADAS team at Greenfield Labs in Palo Alto, California. They’re hard at work on software that will make a big difference for our customers.</p>","<p>8:30 AM – And before hitting the road, I joined a Cars and Coffee event. I got to talk to some of our customers and hear about their experiences with Ford — and their road trip stories! I get so much from these conversations.</p>","<p>This time on the road is about “going and seeing” and learning directly from the people I serve as CEO. So this morning was a great way to start.</p>","<p>10:30 AM – Next, I headed to the Ford Store at Morgan Hill, the #2 F-150 Lightning and #4 Mustang Mach-E dealership in the country. I talked with the team about everything we’re doing together to remake the buying and ownership experience for our customers.</p>","<p>Morgan Hill has used non-negotiated pricing since they opened in 2005. Talk about a way to make our customers’ lives easier … as I heard from this couple whose sales visit I jumped in on!</p>","<p>12:15 PM – Before long, it was time to get back on the road — with a stop at this great fruit and nuts stand along the way. My son Jaimo and I got some delicious fresh peaches!</p>","<p>While I drove, I used BlueCruise, which makes a long trip like this much so much easier. There’s no wonder it’s Consumer Reports’ top ADAS system!</p>","<p>2:45 PM – I had a smooth first charging experience at Harris Ranch. And I’m so excited that Ford customers will be getting access to Tesla’s Supercharger network early next year, which also has a big installation here.</p>","<p>6:00 PM – In Bakersfield, I joined Joe Hay and the team at Jim Burke Ford for an incredible event they put on to support their local community. We used Pro Power Onboard to power a set of bouncy castles as part of a mini-carnival for local kids in partnership with the local Boys &amp; Girls Club.</p>","<p>Jim Burke Ford’s Ford Dimension and Dream Builders program makes such a difference for these kids. It’s such a great example of how our dealerships play critical roles in the communities they serve.</p>","<p>8:30 PM – And as I call it a day, I just have to show off the Lightning’s Frunk.

I first learned that on family trips as a kid. Seeing the ever-changing landscape and the differences of people and places across our vast nation was a touchstone of youth.</p>","<p>As a teenager, I drove across the country in a Mustang I bought for a few hundred dollars and fixed up. Early in my career, I spent nearly a year on the road for Toyota. The insights from that trip helped us make Camry one of the most popular vehicles in America. Hitting the road isn't just about getting somewhere. It's almost always about what you learn along the way.</p>","<p>So, a few of us are setting off this week across the American West in an F-150 Lightning to go and see researchers, businesses, dealers, salespeople, EV conversion shops, EV drivers, and communities. There are things you can’t learn in an office or from a PowerPoint.</p>","<p>We’ll start our journey in Silicon Valley, the cradle of the digital revolution, and drive south to LA and its vibrant car culture. We’ll roll along Route 66, the kitschy trail that once was the Mother Road that gave millions a path west. We’ll hang a left and head for Las Vegas, the glimmering desert oasis that could only happen in America.</p>","<p>We'll use the roads and charging stations that millions of EV drivers are using to power their lives in this new world — and even return to the charging station we visited last year that invited our Tesla deal.</p>","<p>We’ll stop to share experiences as we navigate from the Bay Area to the Mojave Desert, crossing parts of the country that shattered temperature records this year. It's impossible to travel now and overlook weather-related contingencies, which makes our electric transition more urgent.</p>","<p>Long hauling in an electric truck is an act of pioneerism, not because it's hard or dangerous, but because it's a new way to experience America. Shifting from fueling stations to charging stations requires new behaviors and opens new possibilities. Thanks to the technology in the Lightning, I’ll be able to get work done from the road, just like so many of our customers do every day.</p>","<p>From EVs to AI, we’re living at the dawn of a new digital age that can leave us oscillating from unmoored to exhilarated, moment to moment. With this new era upon us, we're preparing <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ford-motor-company/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ford Motor Company</a> to once again be at the forefront.</p>","<p>Ford was built on the idea that everyone should have opportunities to move forward and upward.

This assembly plant was designed by renowned architect Albert Kahn, and was nicknamed the “Crystal Palace” for its many glass windows in the roofs and walls. Construction of the 60-acre plant began in 1908, and vehicle production was moved from Ford’s Piquette Street (Detroit) plant in 1910.</p>","<p>The moving assembly line for automobiles was first operated in Highland Park in October of 1913, and production of Model Ts at the plant went from hundreds a day to thousands a day. As a result, the price of a Model T was reduced from $850 to $260, allowing the average working family to afford one. After Henry Ford instituted the $5 day wage increase in 1914, Highland Park’s employment rose to a peak of almost 70,000 in 1925.</p>","<p>Construction on the site continued to include a powerhouse, a foundry, a cold-press building, a machine shop, and an administration building. By the late-1970s, the site had grown to about 20 structures encompassing roughly 3 million square feet of floor space. In addition to 1 million Model Ts, products assembled at Highland Park include tractors, buses, trucks, aircraft parts, rockets, helmets, engines and interior trim parts.</p>","<p>Ford sold the
