# Ford Marketing Intelligence Memo – Draft Sections

## 2. Strategic Context – Loyalty Baselines
Ford enters FY2025 with a defensible loyalty core that the Ready Set Ford campaign must protect while expanding addressable segments. J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Automotive Brand Loyalty Study reports that Ford retains **65.1%** of truck buyers—the highest loyalty score across any segment—while Toyota and Honda dominate mass-market cars at **62.5%** and **58.8%** respectively, and Lexus leads premium SUVs at **60.2%**.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] These benchmarks establish the minimum performance thresholds for Ready Set Ford’s “Capability” and “Trust” promises: any decline in truck loyalty risks ceding the segment to Toyota (60.8%), while share gains in SUVs require messaging that differentiates Ford against Honda’s 64.2% repeat rate. The memo will frame these numbers as leading indicators in our executive summary dashboard and in segment-specific callouts for Ford Blue and Model e.

## 3. Marketing Intelligence Assessment – Primary Research Roadmap
- **Qualitative Sprint (Oct 6–24, 2025):** Conduct 12 dealer interviews and 18 lifestyle persona ethnographies (Build, Thrill, Adventure) to pressure-test narrative fit, surface proof-point gaps, and collect verbatims for creative briefs. Document findings in `notes/research_notes.md` with `(notes/<file>:line)` references.
- **Quantitative Sprint (Nov 3–21, 2025):** Field a conjoint survey (n≈800) to gauge EV price-value trade-offs, deploy a loyalty pulse survey (n≈1,200) capturing cross-shop behaviors vs. Toyota/Honda, and build a perceptual map aligning Ready Set Ford promises with competitor claims. Anchor questions using benchmarks from `data/external/market_stats.csv`.
- **Operational Analytics Integration:** Instrument dealer portal content analytics, ingest Ford Pro telematics adoption metrics, and join social listening sentiment into the dashboard backlog. Capture metric definitions in the forthcoming BI glossary to ensure maintainers can audit data quality.

## 4. Segment Diagnostics – Leveraging Enthusiast Equity
Ford’s storytelling advantage extends beyond utility vehicle owners. McKinsey’s **Collectible cars** market study estimates the global stock of collectible vehicles at roughly **€800 billion (~$860B)**, with auction transactions averaging **€65,000** and public listings near **€56,000**.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] The report also highlights a record **$143M** sale for Mercedes-Benz’s 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé, underscoring the economic and cultural power of heritage nameplates. Ready Set Ford’s “Thrill” pillar can leverage this passion economy—Mustang special editions, Bronco heritage trims, and limited-run EV performance variants—to drive premium mix and experiential engagement. The diagnostic section will recommend primary research that tests how legacy cues influence purchase intent, and a BI workstream that surfaces collectible-style metrics (limited build counts, waitlist velocity) alongside core financial KPIs. Digital pulse signals reinforce persona targeting: Ready Set Ford searches are emerging from a near-zero baseline while Ford Pro remains the steady anchor, and social chatter clusters around #Ford/#ReadySetFord/#Mustang (#SwapYourRide, #PlanetFord) (notes/research_notes.md:58) (notes/research_notes.md:60).

## 5. Business Intelligence Roadmap – Integrating Lifestyle Signals
To synthesize lifestyle demand with operational KPIs, the BI roadmap will integrate syndicated loyalty data (J.D. Power) and collector-market benchmarks (McKinsey) into Ford’s marketing data mart.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] Loyalty rates will anchor an early-warning scorecard for Ford Blue and Model e, while collectible valuations inform a “Heritage Equity Index” that tracks social listening, limited-edition conversion, and dealer waitlists. Coupled with the refreshed YouTube engagement dataset (`data/external/youtube_metrics.csv`) and visual updates (`deck/visuals/google_trends_readysetford_us.png`, `deck/visuals/twitter_readysetford_top_hashtags.png`), this approach ensures the dashboard ties quantitative benchmarks to Ready Set Ford’s lifestyle promises—Build, Thrill, and Adventure—rather than treating campaign metrics in isolation.

- **Governance Guardrails:** Maintain a marketing data glossary, host monthly analytics stand-ups, and align dashboard releases with Industry 4.0 upskilling modules so insights translate into frontline action (notes/research_notes.md:46).
