- Presentation deck (~12 slides) highlighting key findings, data visuals, and decision-ready recommendations.

## Research Assets On Hand
- 2024 Form 10-K (Ford) – `sources/SEC/Ford_2024_Form_10-K.pdf`
- 2024 Annual Report – `sources/shareholder/Ford_2024_Annual_Report.pdf`
- 2025 DEF 14A – `sources/shareholder/Ford_2025_DEF14A.html`
- External campaign coverage (USA Today, Ford newsroom, Detroit News) – see `sources/external/README.md`
- Class readings: “Marketing Intelligence” (Harvard), Session 6 decks on marketing strategy/intelligence (kept outside repo)
- Transcribed notes and analysis log (`notes/` directory)

## Analysis Workstreams
1. **Marketing Strategy Baseline**
   - Reaffirm Ford+ positioning, segment responsibilities, and Ready Set Ford objectives.
   - Document marketing intelligence frameworks from class materials to anchor analysis (problem definition → research design → data synthesis).
2. **Performance Diagnostics**
   - Compare 2023 vs 2024 segment metrics, highlighting volume/margin shifts and marketing implications.
   - Assess incentives, pricing, and product mix effectiveness using 10-K causal factor disclosures.
3. **Marketing Intelligence Assessment**
   - Map available secondary data (SEC filings, syndicated sources) vs primary data gaps (customer perception, campaign resonance).
   - Identify potential research techniques (conjoint, perceptual mapping, qualitative exploration) informed by class readings.
4. **Business Intelligence & Data Integration**
   - Inventory Ford’s digital data streams (Ford Pro telematics, FordPass, EV telemetry) and align with intelligence needs.
   - Define KPIs for Build/Thrill/Adventure lifestyle pillars and propose dashboards.
5. **Recommendations & Storytelling**
   - Memo structure: Executive Summary, Strategic Context, Marketing Intelligence Assessment, Segment Diagnostics, BI Opportunities, Action Plan, Appendix.
   - Slides: emphasize lifestyle storytelling, intelligence roadmap, quick wins/long-term roadmap.

## Immediate Next Actions
- [x] Extract key frameworks/examples from class notes into `notes/research_notes.md` (Marketing Intelligence section).
- [ ] Deepen secondary research on marketing intelligence applications in automotive (e.g., competitor case studies, syndicated data references).
- [ ] Outline primary research recommendations (qual vs quant) to validate Ready Set Ford positioning.
- [ ] Begin drafting memo sections with new structure; expand slide outline accordingly.
- [ ] Build campaign visuals (financial trends, Google Trends, social listening highlights) for slide deck.
