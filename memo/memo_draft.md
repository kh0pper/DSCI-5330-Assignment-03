# Ford Motor Company – Ready Set Ford Marketing Intelligence Memo (Draft)

## 1. Executive Summary
Ready Set Ford should be positioned as a marketing intelligence flywheel that protects Ford’s loyalty core while unlocking premium growth. Secondary data indicate Ford’s truck loyalty sits at **65.1%**, the highest in the industry, creating a defensible base that must be maintained through Capability and Trust messaging.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] At the same time, emerging lifestyle signals—Google search interest, social chatter, and a vibrant collectible-car economy—show headroom to monetize passion-led segments. We recommend a three-phase roadmap: (1) immediate instrumentation of campaign metrics and dealer storytelling, (2) a 90–180 day research sprint to validate lifestyle promises and EV value propositions, and (3) a 12-month BI build that fuses syndicated loyalty data, telematics, and content engagement into a single dashboard for Ford Blue, Model e, and Ford Pro leaders.

## 2. Strategic Context – Loyalty Baselines
Ford enters FY2025 needing to stoke demand amid EV headwinds, price pressure, and a skills gap in marketing analytics documented in class notes. The J.D. Power 2024 loyalty study reports Toyota (62.5%) and Honda (58.8%) maintaining mass-market car loyalty leadership, Lexus leading premium SUVs at 60.2%, and Ford topping the truck segment at 65.1%.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] These figures set quantitative guardrails around Ready Set Ford’s promises: any erosion in truck loyalty risks delivering the segment to Toyota (60.8%), while to gain SUV share Ford must displace Honda (64.2%) with differentiated Brand + Adventure stories. Incorporating these benchmarks into our dashboards ensures leadership can track lifestyle claims against real customer retention.

## 3. Marketing Intelligence Assessment
Class frameworks emphasize a loop of problem definition → research design → data synthesis. Secondary assets already collected—SEC filings, Ford Pro press releases (ServiceTitan integration, managed charging pilot), J.D. Power loyalty benchmarks, McKinsey insights on heritage value, Google Trends, and Twitter listening—answer “what is happening” today. Primary research gaps remain: qualitative ethnography with lifestyle customers and dealers to test the Build/Thrill/Adventure pillars; quantitative surveys and conjoint to calibrate EV price-value tradeoffs; and dealer analytics to monitor content resonance. The collectors’ economy (≈€800B stock value)^[data/external/market_stats.csv] also warrants targeted research on how legacy nameplates drive willingness to pay for limited editions or premium service bundles.

## 4. Segment Diagnostics – Leveraging Enthusiast Equity
Ford Blue can use Ready Set Ford storytelling to connect heritage pride with practical capability. McKinsey’s collectible-car study quantifies the cultural leverage: average auction prices (~€65k) and listings (~€56k) demonstrate that passion converts into spend, while the $143M sale of Mercedes’ 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé shows how legacy engineering fuels brand halo.^[data/external/market_stats.csv] For Model e, survey work should segment EV intenders by lifestyle pillar and test how heritage cues (Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning) influence conversion. Ford Pro should showcase telematics and charging ROI using the ServiceTitan and Southern Company pilots already parsed in `data/external/ford_press_metrics.csv`. Together, these diagnostics justify a pipeline of hero content and customer research that extends Ready Set Ford beyond awareness.

## 5. Business Intelligence Roadmap – Integrating Lifestyle Signals
We recommend standing up a Ready Set Ford dashboard with three tiers:
- **Loyalty & Retention** – Monthly ingest of J.D. Power loyalty rates and Ford internal retention to flag gaps vs. Toyota/Honda/Lexus targets.^[data/external/market_stats.csv]
- **Lifestyle & Engagement** – Google Trends indices for “Ready Set Ford” vs “Ford Pro,” Twitter volume/hashtag mix, and YouTube view + like rates (see `data/external/youtube_metrics.csv` and `notes/youtube_snapshot.md`).
- **Product & Proof Points** – Ford Pro telematics wins, charging savings, and limited-edition run rates referencing press-release metrics. A “Heritage Equity Index” would track collectible-inspired launches and waitlist velocity, aligned with the €800B collectible market opportunity.
Governance should include a cross-functional intelligence council, a data glossary, and training derived from class Industry 4.0 notes to close the analytics skill gap.

## 6. Recommendations & Next Steps
**0–90 days:** Instrument campaign analytics (YouTube + social dashboards), publish the Ready Set Ford video slide as a living asset, and run qualitative interviews with dealers and target personas to test lifestyle promises. **90–180 days:** Launch conjoint/quant surveys on EV value and capability perceptions, codify telematics case studies, and roll out dealer enablement kits with loyalty benchmarks. **180+ days:** Operationalize the BI dashboard, integrate telematics + CRM feeds, and formalize an annual marketing intelligence plan that cycles datasets from `scripts/collect_additional_data.py` and `scripts/extract_market_stats.py`. These actions transform Ready Set Ford from a creative campaign into a measurable intelligence program that protects Ford’s core while expanding into growth personas.
